# Orca Demand Scan-Core Spec v0 (PROPOSED)

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Product method spec (PROPOSED scan core — pipeline step 2; pending commissioning-lane adjudication and owner word)
scope: >
  The method spec for Orca's scanning function: how an authorized scan walks
  a vertical's venues, recognizes decision-shaped demand situations from the
  demand-read taxonomy's demand-state model (durable / transient /
  manufactured), and emits structured candidate observations with provenance —
  in two modes (backward/backtest case-finding, forward/discovery) over one
  core grammar. Ingests the vertical/venue discovery layer; feeds capture
  (step 3) and candidate recording (step 4). Method only: authorizes no scan
  run, capture, web research, or outreach.
use_when:
  - Commissioning or running an authorized demand scan (backward or forward mode).
  - Checking what a scan hunts, what it emits, to whom, and under which mode obligations.
  - Promoting precursor signals into rich candidate observations after MGT minimum evidence is met.
  - Adjudicating this spec (commissioning ICP / product-direction lane; owner signs adoption).

## Status

`PROPOSED_PENDING_ADJUDICATION` — first authored 2026-06-13 by the commissioned
scanning lane under
`docs/prompts/product-planning/consumer_demand_scanning_lane_commission_prompt_v0.md`
(owner authorization basis 2026-06-12, in-thread: "okay let's prompt this out
to handle - the scanning lane itself"). The commissioning ICP /
product-direction lane adjudicates; the owner signs adoption. Becomes the
operating method for both scan modes only on that word.

**Re-derived 2026-06-16 (owner-directed: "re-derive, then land").** Between the
2026-06-13 draft and this landing, the base drifted substantively on three
surfaces this spec binds, firing all three of the draft's own `stale_if`
triggers — so this is a re-derivation, not a mechanical re-pin:

- **Demand-read taxonomy** (owner-adjudicated 2026-06-14/15): retired "hollow";
  adopted the two-axis demand-state model (persistence: **durable vs transient**;
  integrity: **real vs manufactured**) yielding three actionable states; added
  the **transient-spike read** (equal billing) and the **calling sequence**;
  demoted **divergence to a recognition technique, not a verdict**; ratified the
  pricing refinement; and added the wind-caller naming carve-out. §1 (hunting
  grammar), §3 (`read_type`), §4 (modes), and §6 (wind-caller) are re-derived
  against it.
- **Demand-Substrate Hard Gate** (buyer-proof packet, 2026-06-13 apply): the gate
  moved from a raw "≥2 venue families" count to **de-correlation by origination**
  plus **verb-tiering by commitment**; **retail presence** is reclassified to G4
  org-motion corroboration (excluded from the demand-origin count); and a
  **gradeable costly-behavior floor** with floor-vs-ceiling ordering and a
  divergence defeater. §3 (the schema's gate vocabulary) is re-derived against it.
- **Thesis** (2026-06-14 amendment) and **target-selection brief** slot re-column
  carry the same model; §1/§4/§5 reconciled.

The 2026-06-13 draft's delegated adversarial review (committed alongside as a
dated record: `docs/prompts/reviews/…` + `docs/review-outputs/…`) **predates this
re-derivation and covered the prior schema** — its principle (the gate must be
mechanically checkable from the schema, not re-judged from prose) is preserved
and strengthened here (origination-keyed), but its specific remedy (a four-family
`gate_family` that included `retail_presence`) is superseded by the gate
re-derivation. A fresh adversarial review of this re-derived schema is a
reasonable next step the commissioning lane may commission.

Source-state note: the demand-read taxonomy remains
`PROPOSED_PENDING_OWNER_ADJUDICATION` — every grammar element this spec takes
from it is bound at PROPOSED strength and re-derives if the taxonomy is
adjudicated with further amendments.

## What this is — and is not

Pipeline step 2 (scanning / candidate finding) of the owner's 2026-06-12
six-step structure. A scan is a **guide-governed walk with a recognition
grammar and an emission schema bound on top**: the vertical exploration guide
owns how a walk moves (steps, caps, stop rules, Walker Equipment Kit,
provenance memory); this spec owns what the walk hunts and what it emits.

The scanning README and MGT intelligent-walk operating model are the cold-start
front door. This spec is the richer promoted-observation schema and gate-prep
surface; it should not be forced onto every precursor or low-level move.

- A scan RUNS ONLY under explicit authorization (a batch plan in backward
  mode; an authorized candidate-scan lane in forward mode). No step runs
  standing. This spec authorizes no run.
- It is NOT a monitor, registry, atlas, scraper, source map, capture
  mechanism, or standing intake — the finder frame's and guide's must-not
  boundaries carry unchanged.
- Scan evidence is screening-grade (URLs + short quotes, per the Walker
  Equipment Kit). Packet-grade capture belongs to the capture lane (step 3).
- Cross-spine dependency: unresolved access or source-class questions route to
  the capture playbook/recon index and, for search-interest/AEO, to the
  answer-engine source-class delta; the scan core consumes those pointers but
  authorizes none of them.

## 1. Hunting Grammar

What a scan recognizes, per read type from the taxonomy, per venue class from
the card set's chain (NEWSY: origination launders upward into a citable
record; SUBTLE: nothing launders — the detector IS the record).

The taxonomy's demand-state model has **two independent axes** — persistence
(**durable** vs **transient**) and integrity (**real** vs **manufactured**) —
yielding three actionable read-states. A scan does not guess which state a signal
will become; it records what the receipts currently support. Durable requires a
named persistence-projection basis. Transient is strong real current-window
demand whose durability is not called, or whose evidence supports decay. Weak,
attention-only, or manufactured signals are not transient demand.

### Durable-demand read (real + projected to stay strong → commit / scale as earned)

Trigger: at least two **effectively-independent demand-venue (Venue) origins** (§3
independence rule) moving the same direction on the same trend vector (TrendVector) or brand (Brand),
with at least one **gradeable** costly-behavior signal (sellouts, waitlists,
restock pressure, review velocity/content shifts, pain-point convergence,
dupe-seeking, switching, effortful UGC), plus a named basis for projecting
persistence over the relevant decision horizon — for example observed recurrence,
post-trigger follow-through, repeated costly behavior, analogue history, or
org-motion corroboration in the same direction.

- NEWSY recognition: origination venues (community boards) produce the move;
  trade press corroborates or launders it; org motion (ad launches, hiring
  direction, pipeline/launch signals, retail placements) points the same way.
- SUBTLE recognition: detector or tracker record plus a community wave
  agreeing — independent detection counts as an origin distinct from the
  community discussing it.
- Durable is an **earned projection**: absent a named persistence basis, the same
  strong current-window evidence is recognized as a **transient-spike** read, not
  a durable one (calling-sequence rule below).

### Transient-spike read (real + strong current-window demand → probe / commit in-window)

Trigger: real, gradeable costly behavior with a **short expected lifespan** or
without enough evidence to project persistence — a viral surge, a time-limited
dupe wave, a seasonal pop. This is **not** a weak/default bucket: if demand is
not strong enough to matter, it is a candidate gap or attention signal, not
transient demand.

- NEWSY / SUBTLE recognition: identical to the durable read at the trigger; the
difference is whether the receipts already support a persistence projection. The
scan records the in-window signal, its dates, and the durability basis or gap;
the monitored durable upgrade/reduce decision is **downstream, not the scan's**
(the scan builds no standing monitor).

### Manufactured-demand read (fake / amplified → avoid)

Trigger: demand that is **not real** — promotion-engagement mismatch (promoted
hard, engaging below the channel's own baseline), astroturf / coordinated / bot
amplification, dupe-wave distortion, or a quality attack running where marketing
is loudest. **Divergence is the recognition technique here, not a verdict**: it
is the cross-venue disagreement used to classify a candidate as transient or
manufactured — never noise to average away (thesis integrity layer).

- NEWSY recognition: marketing-loud surfaces versus community sentiment splits
  (the taxonomy's TikTok-vs-IG, Reddit-attacks-under-promo-push examples).
- SUBTLE recognition: detector evidence contradicting brand-maintained claims
  (a silent reformulation detected by INCI diff while marketing continues
  unchanged).
- Per the gate's divergence defeater (§3): if the only costly-behavior signal
  sits inside the same coordinated layer that divergence flags, the read is
  manufactured (the floor is defeated, not merely the ceiling capped).

### Brand-decision event (DecisionEvent) read (the monetization unit)

Trigger: evidence that a specific brand's allocation decision happened or is
visibly imminent — launch / reposition; retail or channel entry or exit;
restock / sellout handling; discontinuation / moratorium; defend-versus-hype;
event-triggered pricing. The demand-state read (durable / transient /
manufactured), wind-caller state, and integrity labels are context that makes
the event decide-grade and set the action ceiling — commit or scale when origins
converge and persist; probe or monitor when they do not.

- NEWSY recognition: brand statement or trade coverage of the decision;
  founder quotes; community detection that trade press adopts as canonical.
- SUBTLE recognition: no brand statement exists — the detector record IS the
  evidence, under the guide's corroborated material-change A-leg: material
  evidence of the change from 2+ INDEPENDENT origins PLUS a community detection
  wave. A single origin never mints a candidate.

### Wind-caller (WindCaller) calibration read (the compounding asset)

Trigger: a channel (or named public-figure creator, per §6) whose dated public
call (Call) preceded a move or event the scan can date. Calibration grades the call on
**both** whether the move happened **and how long it lasted** (a caller good at
durable shifts and one good at spikes are different and both valuable). The scan
records a calibration-ready call record (§6); grading itself is downstream
outcome-memory machinery, never the scan's act.

### Calling-sequence rule for scans (PROPOSED absorption — adjudication surface)

The taxonomy's calling sequence is now: current-window transient unless a named
durability basis is already in the information set → monitor → earn, revise, or
reduce the durable projection. For a point-in-time scan this absorbs as: **the
scan classifies demand-state conservatively without weakening transient** — weak
or attention-only input is not transient demand; transient means strong real
current-window demand whose durability is not called or whose evidence supports
decay; durable means the receipts already support a persistence projection. The
monitored upgrade/reduce step is a **downstream act outside the scan's authority**
(the scan builds no standing monitor; passive monitoring, where authorized, is a
separate capture-lane act under the wind-caller carve-out's Tier-1 discipline).
*This absorption is flagged for adjudication — the commissioning lane may accept
it or direct a different scan-time classification rule.*

### Anti-triggers (explicit; none of these mints a candidate)

- **Price-complaint volume — never a trigger.** Chronic, non-discriminating,
  ungradeable (taxonomy pricing refinement, **owner-ratified 2026-06-14**). The
  exception is real: **price-driven rerouting** (dupe adoption, trade-down,
  switching with stated cause) is gradeable costly behavior and IS a trigger —
  usually a transient read, durable when a price move drives permanent defection
  to a cheaper brand (the read classifies which). An event-triggered pricing
  decision (happened or visibly imminent) IS a brand-decision event. Complaint
  chatter alone triggers neither.
- **Attention/engagement volume alone** — at most a look-here cue for the
  walk; a candidate requires gradeable costly-behavior or decision-event
  evidence (thesis costly-behavior primitive). Absence of demand ("velocity
  miss," falling engagement) is never a costly-behavior pass.
- **Availability alone** — movement over availability (owner word); presence
  on a shelf is not a read.
- **Prominence** — fame is not relevance; in backward mode it is a FAME flag
  obligation (case-finder bar), never a selection criterion.
- **Person-level signals beyond the wind-caller carve-out** — org-level signals
  only, except the bounded internal wind-caller naming permitted in §6. No
  outreach or contact lists (Tier 3, absolute); no audience / follower-graph
  analysis (Tier 2, deferred-gated); LinkedIn stays org-level (unchanged).

Precursor signals may route the walk, explain a pivot, or justify a later
`capture_request`, but they do not mint a candidate unless the promotion and
candidate-entry rules below are met.

## 2. Walk Order

How a scan consumes the venue layer. For a vertical with a promoted card set
(beauty today), the guide's Step-0 rule applies: **read the card set FIRST**,
then the provenance grep (`rg -l "Screen Provenance|Venue Provenance" docs/`).

- **Chain order.** Enter NEWSY via the trade hubs (cards 1–3), brand-story
  press first; ingredient/market press only when hunting regulatory forcing
  functions (guide trade-press fork). Enter SUBTLE via origination/tracker
  cards (4–9) and detector cards (10–12).
- **Mode inflection.** Backward mode may enter NEWSY-first: resolved events
  are already laundered into the citable record, then traced back to
  origination for pre-cutoff depth. Forward mode weights origination and
  detector cards: detection precedes press by weeks-to-months (card 8), and
  freshness is the forward constraint.
- **Fail-soft cards.** Cards are dated hints, never current-state claims. A
  card that fails its access shape is an ACCESS-NOTE under the Walker
  Equipment Kit (escalate the read shape within screening posture, record
  shapes tried, move on). A scan never edits a card; card maintenance is
  owner review-date work.
- **Dead/thin list respected.** Known dead/thin venues are not re-walked
  without stated reason.
- **Discovery beyond the cards** follows the guide's Steps 1–3 (defaults
  pass, hub-finding, expand-on-signal) under its caps and stop rules; newly
  productive precursor surfaces or venues land in the scan's provenance block,
  never appended to any standing list.

## 3. Candidate Observation Schema

Precursor signals stay in the MGT/minimum-evidence layer until they are worth
carrying for downstream gate or capture evaluation. Promotion into this richer
schema requires the signal to tie to a URL, decision window or candidate, and a
possible gate role; a precursor by itself is not gate proof.

Two record shapes: the **observation (Observation)** (one venue × one signal) and the
**candidate entry** (one brand × one decision, aggregating observations).
Both are emitted into the scan's own dated artifact (homes in §5).

### Independence rule (de-correlation by origination)

The re-derived Demand-Substrate Hard Gate counts **effectively-independent
demand-venue origins**, not a raw venue-family count. An independent origin
traces to a **distinct origination event**: signals on the same `derived_from`
chain — or tracing to a common upstream origination event or a shared
coordinated origination — **collapse to one** origin. Pairwise "neither derives
from the other" is insufficient (two laundered siblings of one event satisfy it
while violating independence). The schema therefore records origination lineage
so the gate check is mechanical, not judgment-at-consumption.

### Observation record

```yaml

```

`venue_family` / `gate_family` vocabulary note (gate checkability): the
re-derived Demand-Substrate Hard Gate counts independence across its demand
families — `review_surfaces`, `forums_community`, `search_interest` — and counts
**distinct origins**, not distinct family labels. **`retail_presence` is now G4
org-motion corroboration, EXCLUDED from the demand-origin count** (it is neither
a deprecated label nor a sourcing gap); the non-demand-origin families
`trade_press`, `tracker_detector`, `org_motion_surface`, and `creator_social` are
likewise evidence/corroboration venues that take `gate_family: none`. Public YouTube videos/Shorts can feed
`creator_social` when they provide a dated public call or campaign context, but
not comments, channel/person dossiers, graphs, or monitoring. If a trade-press
receipt launders a community-originated
demand signal, `venue_family` stays `trade_press`, `gate_family` records the
underlying demand family evidenced, and `origination_ref` ties it back to the
single origin (so a laundered chain never counts as multiple origins). A
`gate_family` value is recorded only on an observation whose own venue is that
demand family AND whose `origination_ref` is distinct. Today only
`forums_community` is sourced; `review_surfaces` and `search_interest` are
owner-owned unsourced gaps — a scan records them as gaps, never as satisfied.

### Candidate entry

```yaml
candidate_id:
mode: backward | forward
brand:                    # + parent where visible
vertical_subniche:

zero_spoiler_feasibility: # backward only — can a pre-cutoff packet be built without outcome leakage? (note, not proof)
outcome_note:             # backward only — what resolved and when

```

**Gate outcome is by tier, not a single hard count** (buyer-proof gate): a
candidate FAILS the gate only when the **floor cannot clear** — no gradeable
costly-behavior instance in any qualifying demand-venue family
(engagement/attention volume alone never clears it), or no qualifying
demand-venue origin at all. With the floor cleared on **one** independent
origin, the read is admissible but **capped at hold / low-commitment**; any material
or irreversible commitment — **commit or scale** — requires **≥2 independent converging
origins**. A single clean origin is a ceiling cap, not an automatic failure.

`decision_owner_pointer` boundary: role-level by default; a name appears only
when it is itself the public receipt (a founder quoted on the decision).
Org-level signals only — no person-level dossiers in any sold or external
surface (the contact gate is closed). The one bounded exception is internal
wind-caller naming under the carve-out (§6), which is internal-calibration-only
and never enters a sold or published surface.

### Shape reconciliation

- **Backward → pool row** (candidate-pool handoff columns): Brand ←
  `brand`; Vertical ← `vertical_subniche`; Decision (one line) ←
  `decision_context`; Class ← `venue_class`; Flags ← `flags`; Source ledger ←
  the scan's dated artifact. The pool's flag vocabulary and consuming-batch
  obligations carry unchanged.
- **Forward → brief slot columns** (target-selection brief, re-columned
  2026-06-14): Candidate context ← `brand` + `decision_context`; Decision
  family ← `decision_family`; **Independent demand-venue origins visible** ←
  `gate_check.independent_origins_seen` (laundered / shared-origination copies =
  one; org-motion / retail excluded); Costly-behavior evidence visible ←
  `gate_check.costly_behavior_floor`; Org-motion route available ←
  `gate_check.org_motion_route`; Named decision owner ←
  `decision_owner_pointer`; Status ← the discovery lane's own call. Slot-tier
  guidance carried verbatim: **1 independent origin → hold/low-commitment
  ceiling; ≥2 converging origins → material-action eligible.** The scan fills no
  slot — it produces the dated scan doc a slot may be filled from.

## 4. Two Modes, One Core

One grammar (§1), one walk discipline (§2), one schema (§3). The modes differ
in purpose, outcome posture, entry weighting, output home, and freshness.

| | Backward (backtest case-finding) | Forward (discovery / targeted) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Surface resolved, decision-grade cases (Case) for backtest batches | Surface live/imminent decisions (for the brief's blank slots, or for a commissioned single target) |
| Outcome posture | Outcome-bearing by design | Outcome-free (no outcome exists yet) |
| Walk entry | NEWSY-first allowed (laundered record, trace back) | Origination/detector-weighted (freshness) |
| Output home | Scan's dated ledger; pool vN consolidates | `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_*.md` (brief record home), or a dated single-decision scan doc (targeted) |
| Freshness | Cutoff-window framed | 21-day scan-to-use maximum (below) |

**Forward mode runs in two entry shapes.** Same core grammar, schema, and gate;
they differ only in entry trigger and output home:

- **Discovery slot-filling.** The default forward shape: a vertical-scoped walk
  hunting live/imminent decisions to fill the target-selection brief's blank
  slots. Output home: the brief's bound record home.
- **Commission-driven targeted.** A single named company/decision arrives (a
  commission), and the gate-forward grammar produces the collection plan for
  that one read — what venues to walk, which origins and gate columns the read
  must clear, what would qualify or disqualify it. Output home: a dated
  single-decision scan doc (not a brief slot); the brief's slot-fill rule still
  governs if that read is later promoted to a slot. This is distinct from broad
  slot-filling and is named explicitly so a demand commission is not blind
  before discovery → capture → ECR. *(This thin targeted mode was the
  commission's open "resolve-first" question; resolved here by addition rather
  than assumed under slot-filling.)*

**Backward contamination posture.** The scanner is facilitator-side and
outcome-exposed by design — it hunts events because they resolved. Its
discipline is therefore not blindness but containment: (i) the scan direction
(vertical × decision family) is declared before walking, and every in-scope
candidate found is recorded, hits and non-hits alike (anti-cherry-pick — no
outcome-flattering selection); (ii) every candidate carries a
`zero_spoiler_feasibility` note (whether a pre-cutoff packet (CapturePacket) looks buildable
without the outcome leaking) and prominence is flagged FAME for the
case-finder bar; (iii) no candidate is minted from the scanning model's own
memory — every claim is URL-backed (Walker Equipment Kit rule 7; the frame's
self-reference trap); (iv) recognition probes, swaps, admission, dev/holdout
splits, and packet construction belong to the CONSUMING batch under the
finder frame's operative bar and the pool's consuming-batch obligations — the
scan runs none of them.

**Forward freshness/decay rule.** A live 30–90-day decision read goes stale
in weeks. Every forward observation carries `retrieval_date`; every forward
candidate entry carries `stale_after` = earliest load-bearing
`retrieval_date` + 21 days. **Maximum scan-to-use age: 21 days** from
retrieval to slot-qualification use (PROPOSED default — adjudicate or amend
by dated note). This bounds **observation freshness**, and is distinct from a
full decay-curve forecast: the scan may record the basis for a durability
projection or the absence of one, but the exact decay curve and monitored
upgrade/reduce decision stay downstream. Past `stale_after`, the entry may not
feed a slot until the load-bearing observations are re-verified (fresh retrieval
of the same receipts, refreshing `retrieval_date`); re-verification is a bounded
re-read, not a new scan. Forward entries record no predictions as outcomes;
`outcome_note` stays empty in forward mode.

**Mode wall.** The backtest candidate pool is NEVER a forward-mode slot
source (brief rule, owner word DB-4). If a forward scan independently
re-observes a live decision at a brand that also sits in the pool, the dated
forward scan doc is the slot source and must stand on its own fresh
observations; the pool row is neither imported nor cited as qualification
evidence.

## 5. Handoff Contracts

### To capture (step 3)

Per candidate entry, the scan emits a **capture_request** (the shared scanning
vocabulary term for the older "capture-needs list"): venue + URL set + which
observation and which gate column the capture would support + the window
(cutoff-bounded for backward; freshness-bounded for forward).
Boundaries, all hard:

- Per-venue route bindings are capture-lane-owned. The scan CITES the
  current binding state it relied on (e.g., a card's recorded read shape) and
  may say `route: unknown`; it never sets, stretches, or recommends a route.
  Route expansion is a capture-lane decision (thesis ask-1 posture: measured
  ToS risk accepted, absurd-level rejected — applied there, not here).
- Scan evidence stays screening-grade. Nothing the scan collected is
  packet-grade; capture re-acquires under its own provenance discipline.
- Unresolved access walls are the ORCHESTRATOR's close-out duty: every wall
  routes to the capture seam (playbook / recon index) before that vertical's
  next scan (guide rule, carried).

### To candidate recording (step 4)

- **Backward:** candidate entries land in the scan's own dated ledger with a
  `Screen Provenance` (or lane-appropriate `Venue Provenance`) block per the
  guide — verbatim section names; append-only; negative set included. Pool
  consolidation is a separate cut under the pool's own rules (one-shot,
  dated, never updated in place; source ledgers remain the source of truth;
  flag vocabulary verbatim).
- **Forward (discovery):** candidate entries land in a dated scan doc at
  `docs/research/orca_discovery_candidate_scan_<slug>_v0.md` (the brief's
  bound record home), provenance-noted. Slot-filling is the discovery lane's
  act under the brief's slot-fill rule; near-miss, hold, and
  disqualification records go to the proof-batch notes home.
- **Forward (targeted):** the single-decision read lands in its own dated scan
  doc; it is not a brief slot unless and until the discovery lane promotes it
  under the brief's slot-fill rule.
- Candidate companies are not buyers, leads, prospects, or clients; the
  no-buyer-contact gate is closed and this spec does not touch it.

## 6. Wind-Caller Sub-Procedure

Per sub-niche, inside any authorized scan (both modes):

1. **Identification.** When a walk move yields an influence observation (the
   guide's widening: hubs, pointing structures, byline concentration), test
   for wind-caller candidacy: a channel, including a public YouTube video or
   Short that carries a dated public call, or a named public-figure creator,
   per the carve-out below, whose dated public call preceded a move or event
   the scan can date, in this sub-niche, with a receipt. Pointing chains
   terminate at wind callers; INCIDecoder (card 11) is the worked exemplar —
   its commissioned tests became the root receipt an entire event chain cites.
2. **Call record** (calibration-ready means a later grading pass can score
   hit/miss without re-derivation):

```yaml
caller_channel:    # channel name + platform/venue
caller_public_figure:  # public handle + public name — ONLY for named public-figure creators, internal-calibration use only (carve-out); else null
subniche:
call:              # direction + object (trend vector or brand decision)
call_date:
call_receipt:      # URL + retrieval date
preceded:          # the move/event it preceded, with dates, where resolvable
latency:           # call date → event/market date
graded_on:         # whether-it-happened AND how-long-it-lasted (durable vs transient), per the taxonomy
outcome_status: resolved | open   # backward: usually resolved; forward: open
```

3. **Anti-cherry-pick.** Record the calls found in scope whether they look
   like hits or misses; calibration GRADING is outcome-memory machinery
   downstream, never the scan's act.
4. **Boundaries (hard) — reconciled to the wind-caller carve-out
   (`docs/decisions/wind_caller_calibration_carveout_v0.md`, owner-signed
   2026-06-13, amended through 2026-06-15):**
   - **Naming a public-figure creator wind-caller is permitted for INTERNAL
     calibration only** — public handle, public name, public calls, public
     stats, call-vs-outcome calibration — recorded **non-permanently**
     (time-bounded; 10-year retention ceiling + takedown-on-request).
   - **No sold or externally published person-level surface** (Tier 3,
     absolute, unchanged); no outreach or contact lists; no special-category or
     private/auth-gated data; no audience / follower-graph analysis (Tier 2,
     deferred-gated). The external/product boundary is unchanged.
   - **Public YouTube video/Shorts calls are admissible only as dated, non-login
     public-call receipts**; no comment scraping, channel enumeration,
     subscriber/follower graph, channel/person dossier, or standing channel
     observation is created by the scan.
   - **The scan does only screening-grade identification + the call record
     above.** Deeper calibration capture (platform stats, Social Blade, the
     bounded passive-monitoring runs) is a **capture-lane act under the
     carve-out's Tier-1 discipline (≤10 own operating accounts, attended-active
     / bounded-self-terminating-passive, US-first), not the scan's.** *(This
     scan-vs-capture boundary is a PROPOSED absorption — flagged for
     adjudication.)*
   - **In-scan observation only** — standing observation of any channel is a
     monitor, forbidden to the scan. No wind-caller registry, atlas, or card
     set arises from scans; consolidation of influence trails routes only
     through the guide's promote-on-reuse trigger, owner-decided. Call records
     are dated history, never current-state claims about a channel's
     reliability.
   - **LinkedIn org-motion is a separate context, completely unchanged** — this
     spec does not absorb the separate LinkedIn/org-motion decision context.

- **Demand-read taxonomy** — this spec ABSORBS its demand-state model (durable /
  transient / manufactured; divergence as a recognition technique; the scan-time
  strong current-window transient / durable projection-basis classification) into
  the hunting grammar (§1) and the schema (§3). It LEAVES with the taxonomy the
  model's ownership and any ontology / decision-grade proof, which the taxonomy
  explicitly defers to a separate pass. The taxonomy is PROPOSED; this spec
  re-derives if it is adjudicated with further amendments.
- **Demand-Substrate Hard Gate (buyer-proof packet)** — this spec ABSORBS the
  re-derived gate (origination-independence, verb-tiering by commitment, retail
  excluded, the gradeable costly-behavior floor, the divergence defeater) into
  §3 so the gate is mechanically checkable from a scan's emitted schema. It
  redefines nothing in the gate; it makes the gate's columns fillable.
- **Vertical exploration guide** — this spec ABSORBS the candidate-finding
  intent of the walk: what a scan hunts (§1), how it consumes the venue layer
  (§2), what it emits (§3), and the mode semantics (§4). It LEAVES with the
  guide: all walk mechanics (Steps 0–5, move caps, dry rule, ACCESS-NOTE
  semantics, the Walker Equipment Kit, Screen/Venue Provenance memory, the
  promote-on-reuse trigger and its thresholds). A scan is a guide-governed
  walk; this spec amends nothing in the guide. If adoption requires the guide
  to point here, that is a dated note routed at adjudication, not performed
  by this lane.
- **Memorization-resistant case-finder frame** — the frame OWNS the
  backward-mode admission bar (operative obscurity bar, decision-grade +
  source-depth floor, zero-spoiler, decide-vs-confirm tension,
  anti-cherry-pick) and the recognition/probe protocol. This spec ABSORBS
  only the scan-time obligations that make that bar checkable later (FAME
  flagging, zero-spoiler feasibility notes, declared-direction
  anti-cherry-pick, URL-backed-only minting) and LEAVES admission, probes,
  swaps, and splits to the consuming batch. The scan extends the frame's
  screen; it does not replace it.
- **Candidate-pool handoff / target-selection brief** — own the destination
  shapes (backward consolidated pool; forward slots and record homes). This
  spec emits INTO those shapes (§3 reconciliation, §5 contracts) and
  redefines neither; their obligations bind their consumers unchanged.
- **Wind-caller calibration carve-out** — owns the naming / internal-use /
  retention / external-boundary policy; §6 cites it and stays inside it.

## Hard Constraints (carried)

Docs-first: no implementation, code, automation, dashboards, or runners. This
spec authorizes no scan execution, capture, web research, or outreach.
US-market default: non-US candidates are flagged and route to the owner or
defer (pool/brief obligations mirrored). Capture route bindings are
capture-lane-owned — cited, never set. The backtest candidate pool is never a
forward-mode slot source. Amendments are dated notes only; no silent
rewrites.

## Non-Claims

PROPOSED method spec only — not doctrine, not validation, readiness, buyer
proof, or judgment-quality evidence; closeout state for any such claim:
`no_durable_evidence`. Mints no evidence-ladder vocabulary; redefines no
overlay-owned semantics; does not adjudicate the taxonomy, the Hard Gate, the
thesis, or the carve-out it binds from. Authorizes no scan, capture,
monitoring, outreach, or build; every consuming lane keeps its own
authorization boundary.

**Adjudication surfaces** (named so the commissioning lane can accept or amend
them explicitly, not silently baked):

- The 21-day forward freshness default (§4).
- The scan-time demand-state classification rule (§1): weak/attention-only input
  is not transient demand; transient is strong current-window demand; durable
  requires a named persistence-projection basis. The scan-vs-capture-lane
  boundary for wind-caller calibration (§6) remains unchanged.
- The `gate_family` demand-family set now excludes `retail_presence` and treats
  re-derived Hard Gate.
- The commission-driven targeted forward entry shape (§4).
