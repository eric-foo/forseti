# Semantic Evidence Integration Contract v124

## Purpose

Semantic Evidence Integration turns Collection's final output into a
meaning-aware proposition view before downstream synthesis. It exists because
a large, well-captured corpus can still be underused, misbound to the wrong
product or competitor, or summarized from a convenient handful of citations.

**Collection** owns capture and acquisition, locator and source-artifact hash
verification, normalization, denominator and product binding, merge, and
materialization. Its final output is the existing hash-bound
`semantic_evidence_source_v3` plus its matching
`phase_a_semantic_materialization_receipt_v1`. The source is the complete
consumer input; the receipt is Collection's lineage record and is not a new
`prepare-batches` argument.

This is a shared Judgment capability. An acquisition route may invoke it as a
pre-seal closure job, but does not own or redefine its claim-support semantics.
The existing intelligence claim-support contract remains the authority for
support posture, independence, conflict, source-role fitness, and causal
ceiling.

Semantic Evidence Integration is the runtime capability inside the named
**Evidence Consolidation** stage. That stage starts from Collection's immutable,
completely accounted materialized source and owns semantic leaf triage, atomic
evidence structuring, meaning-based cross-source reconciliation, and
evidence-packet projection. `prepare-batches` verifies that the source content
matches its stored `source_sha256`; it does not reopen the Collection locators
embedded for provenance. Current selection consumers likewise keep missing
publication times unavailable instead of reopening those locators. Historical
unmaterialized sources without that stored hash retain their locator
verification, and historical bundles without a materialized-source identity
retain their existing metadata fallback. Selection manifests v2 and later and
no-frontier axis manifests v3 and later bind this portable-date behavior.
Earlier selection v1 and no-frontier manifest v2 straddle the boundary: replay
first derives the portable inventory, then may use the prior hash-verified
publication-time fallback only if the complete original inventory hash matches.
This preserves both historical date behaviors without rewriting any source,
manifest, candidate, or reader output. Missing or changed legacy source bytes
cannot become a successful replay; new materialized manifests never use this
fallback. Historical replay may therefore still depend on its pinned Collection
artifacts, but does not rerun Collection or establish current-method execution.
Consolidation's output is the complete
evidence retrieval surface consumed by the acquisition seal and later Deliver
work. This stage boundary does not create or rename a globally numbered phase;
historical Phase A, Phase B, Turn B, Understanding, and Deliver vocabulary
remains unchanged.

It is not a market conclusion, recommendation, sentiment score, representative
estimate, causal model, custom-trained model, embeddings service, vector store,
or graph database.

## Operating location

**Instruction loading for this stage.** From the repository root, use
`node .agents/tools/read_source.mjs --file PATH --heading "SECTION"`
with the actual instruction file and section name; omit `--heading` when the
needed section is not yet known. If a selected section is too large, replace
`--heading` with explicit inclusive `--from N --to N` lines and read successive
ranges until the whole relevant section is covered. A `not_read` response never
counts as a completed read. Check per-source `error` first and correct an invalid
request; otherwise use the returned headings or line bounds to narrow the read.
If the source is unavailable or even one line cannot be returned, report the
specific unread source gap instead of repeating the same request or relying on
missing content. Reuse instructions already loaded in this task unless they
changed or the decision requires a fresh check. The reader limits instruction
output only; it does not reduce the admitted evidence set, authorize sampling,
or waive any consolidation or completeness requirement.

For broad consumer-brand Understanding:

```text
SERP Phase 1 -> evidence fan-out -> SERP Phase 2 and adaptive returns
-> all selected acquisition jobs terminal
-> Collection emits materialized source plus receipt
-> Evidence Consolidation / Semantic Evidence Integration
-> any affected-axis delta work terminal and integration regenerated
-> acquisition seal
-> Synthesize
```

The integration job may expose a material missing class or emerging axis. The
controller then reopens only the affected acquisition family. Any changed
corpus invalidates the prior integration view; the final seal points only to a
view compiled from the final corpus hash.

## Division of labor

The semantic agent owns only meaning:

- interpret paraphrases rather than match literal wording;
- split one source item when it makes different product, comparator, axis, or
  conditional statements;
- preserve negation, uncertainty, product/version identity, and conditions;
- relate a semantic unit as support, opposition, or adjacent context; and
- nominate an emerging axis when no existing axis fits honestly.

The intelligence claim-support contract's **Meaning-preserving interpretation
and useful abstraction** rule governs authoring and review here. Consolidation
may express a useful common claim without requiring lexically identical or
equally detailed sources. First-hand preferences and stated intentions may be
`customer_experience` claims when their meaning stays explicit; `reported_behavior`
credits `behavior_evidence_refs` and requires the behavior actually reported,
not a desired or future act. Source-role competence alone does not choose that
meaning. Do not create a new schema kind or silently relabel a frozen answer.

For a separately commissioned targeted benchmark audit,
`TARGETED_AUDIT_METHOD_TEXT` in the
[semantic integration implementation](../../../../../forseti-harness/judgment/semantic_evidence_integration.py)
owns `targeted_benchmark_audit_method_v2`: assess fidelity at the decision-relevant
bounded-finding level and preserve consequential differences. This scoped audit
method does not change production consolidation or add an audit to ordinary runs.
The 2026-09-01 owner disposition in [history v95](forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog)
accepts the observed audit-order sensitivity as a visible residual for that broad
Phase A use; it installs no standing mirror, repeat-review gate, or new audit
machinery. A later commission may make finer descriptive distinctions material.

Deterministic code owns:

- the admitted evidence denominator and exact per-alias accounting;
- Collection-time source-artifact resolution and hashes, followed by
  materialized-source hash verification at the Consolidation boundary;
- stable batch, semantic-unit, proposition, corpus, and view identity;
- actor/origin de-duplication and conservative credited-public-origin counts;
- engagement availability;
- authority-owned source-role competence and impossible combinations;
- claim-support projection; and
- stale/incomplete-view rejection at the acquisition seal.

The agent never chooses its own evidence count, independence count, support
posture, cross-venue credit, or causal strength.

Verified method-v7 continuations may explicitly select reconciliation response
v3 on a fresh stage. The decision compiler derives the existing exact child
conditions and identities and supplies the same source-role competence rules
that validation enforces. This is an authoring route over the original verified
method, not a method migration: v7 defaults and historical responses retain their
original replay. Missing decisions and incompetent claims still fail. The public
runner uses the current identity-v2 packing for this explicit route; no completed
legacy answer may be rebound to an unexecuted decision request.

This ownership also applies to `bounded_meaning` prose. Current response-v3
normal and missing-definition authoring use count-neutral reported wording,
not a headcount inferred from attached statements or comments: the compact
candidate view does not expose complete author identities. Keep actual
source-attributed claims about other people attributed; do not delete them or
promote them into verified counts. Code still supplies origin/observation
accounting. Inverse comparisons may express the same fact, but the current node
shape requires one exact stored subject/comparator orientation; retain opposite
orientations separately without relabeling child identity. This is a transport
constraint, not a claim that the meanings differ or represent separate events.

Current authoring uses run v11 / integration method v13 / row-verification
method v12. `CURRENT_AXES` alone supplies valid output axis IDs. Category names
in the semantic examples below describe meaning, not fixed identifiers or
mandatory assignments across companies. The agent selects supplied IDs by the
unit's meaning and the supplied labels; it never imports Summer Fridays IDs
into a different inventory. Where no current axis fits, preserve supported
meaning with empty `axis_ids` and an emerging-axis label where appropriate.
Code still rejects foreign IDs; it does not translate categories or infer fit.
Earlier run/method identities and their prompt bytes remain historical replay,
not current cross-company authoring. No frozen output is rewritten or silently
promoted into the new generation.

Method v13 teaches the existing normalization stage to preserve source-attributed
outcomes, forecasts, earlier interest, and distinct action objects without adding
an analyst's unstated threshold. Verifier v12 checks those same boundaries in
the whole row. Neither stage infers a purchase from use or turns resuming use
into a merchandise return. Prior method/verifier texts retain their original
identities; the new generation adds instruction bytes, not another model stage.

Upstream `product_candidates` are hypotheses, not product truth. For the
current method, every admitted item also carries source-pinned product context
such as a thread title, parent text, post text, product page, creator post, or
source scope. The agent may bind an exact product only from the evidence text
together with that context. Context establishes what the item is about; it
does not donate unstated claims to the item's author. If the binding remains
unclear, the item stays `unresolved` or `out_of_scope`.

### Local reconciliation correction

Current response-v3 generation expresses optional retention as mutually exclusive
attached/nonempty-unmerged alternatives. Native validation retains the same
rejection boundary; frozen v1/v2 replay and already valid v3 responses are not
rewritten. Generation-schema compliance is not a semantic verdict.

When validation or source-aware review identifies a specific reconciliation
problem, `prepare_reconciliation_repair` binds an explicit nomination (node keys
and/or candidate refs plus reason) to the exact original response and stage.
It includes the connected component of all affected candidate/node attachments,
exact leaf text, parent/product context, and compiler-derived source inventory.
Inventory is not claim support: one shared identity remains one credited origin,
but only the established finalizer determines which sources support a claim.
An allegation is not a verdict; review may retain the original choices.

Before emitting a repair request, preparation reuses the compiler's exact
product/comparator/version compatibility check across the original response's
attached groups. If a known incompatible group remains outside the nominated
connected components, preparation fails and lists every omitted group. The
operator must nominate a complete scope explicitly; code does not expand it
silently or choose replacement meanings. This prevents paying for a correction
whose unchanged identity conflict already guarantees rejection. It does not
detect prose errors or promise that no other native defect remains. Previously
valid repair requests and successors retain exact replay; an incomplete request
that could never yield a valid successor is now rejected before the call.

If the existing repair prompt exceeds the stage's byte limit, preparation tries
`PACKED_REPAIR_CONTEXT_V1` before rejecting it. This is a lossless layout of the
same connected component, not a smaller evidence selection: uniform records
may share identical fields and ordered column headings, with every row retained.
JSON types, missing-versus-null distinctions, literal text, source identity,
conditions and ownership remain unchanged. Heterogeneous record shapes remain
lists. The full uncompressed context still binds the request; the consumer
rederives both context and prompt before applying any patch. Previously fitting
requests, response schemas, correction authority and normal authoring remain
unchanged. A still-oversized packet fails before any provider call. Packing
adds no semantic judgment, source retrieval or standing provider stage; model
understanding and correction quality require source-aware assessment.

Use the existing isolated provider route for at most one corrective attempt.
This is failure/review-only work, never a required extra normal-path stage.
The response replaces only that component or explicitly refuses. Code never
infers meaning, chooses a relation, edits upstream facts, or silently supplies
a definition. The full native consumer must accept the successor; other defects
may still block it. The repair model cannot emit `opposition_checked`: code
preserves it only for an exactly unchanged definition and its attachment
decisions, otherwise invalidates it to false. This withdraws prior clearance;
it never awards a new check or semantic approval. Changed or regrouped nodes
therefore remain unchecked for the established relation-closure boundary.
Unaffected definitions, decisions,
label assignments, source identities and original bytes remain preserved.

The public runner's `prepare-reconciliation-repair` and
`submit-reconciliation-repair` commands bind raw input bytes, rederive the
request, reject scope escape, and verify the durable successor on first write
and repeat reuse. A context component that exceeds the existing prompt limit
fails without truncation. Missing definitions alone retain the narrower existing
definition-recovery route. No standing census, retry loop, prose classifier,
additional count renderer, or independent review ceremony is installed.

`prepare-reconciliation-repair` also writes a hash-pinned
`semantic_judgment_job_v1` descriptor with phase `reconciliation_repair` and
returns its generated `worker_prompt`, `job_path` and `job_sha256`. A controller
forwards that prompt unchanged rather than handwriting a delivery wrapper; it
reuses the shared `intake-judgment-job` complete delivery. `submit-judgment-job`
routes such a job to this same repair consumer, which writes
`successor/response.json` and `successor/receipt.json` inside the request
directory, and returns both exact paths. Changed pinned bytes fail before intake
and before submission. This binds transport only: repair scope, semantic
instructions, response schema, the one-attempt rule, and the absence of any
error detector all remain unchanged.

After a current response-v3 validation failure, the read-only
`diagnose-reconciliation-response` command may inventory every independently
observable defect in its declared mechanical scope before a repair is nominated.
The unchanged validator still supplies `primary_validation_error` and remains
the sole acceptance boundary. The diagnostic reports exact affected candidate
and node handles for the recurring repair-relevant graph defects: duplicate
attachments, missing or orphaned definitions, identity incompatibility,
repeated leaves, and missing effective terminal support. When a malformed
prerequisite makes a downstream check ambiguous, it records that check as
skipped instead of guessing another failure. The report is write-once,
deterministic, current-v3-only, and makes no provider call. It neither selects a
repair scope nor proves semantic warrant; source-aware judgment and the existing
bounded repair routes remain unchanged.

Diagnostic v2 makes a repeated-leaf issue actionable without choosing its
repair. It lists every duplicated `semantic_unit_ref`, then for each leaf lists
every entering path as the child ref, child-to-node relation, child leaf
relation, and derived effective relation. The same deterministic structure is
included in a repeated-leaf local-repair context under
`duplicate_leaf_conflicts`. It is derived only from already-supplied candidates
and attachments; it does not select a child to detach, deduplicate a leaf, alter
a relation, or award semantic warrant. Enumerated paths are always exact, and
they are complete wherever node ownership is fully observed. Where a malformed
decision or attachment could still hide an entering child, the diagnostic keeps
the observed paths and records that node in `skipped_dependent_checks` instead
of presenting a partial collision as the complete one; the bounded repair route
never packs a partial collision because it already rejects any malformed
decision or attachment. Repeated-leaf requests use repair-request
v2. Clean components keep their prior v1 request bytes, and the composer
rederives stored v1 requests by their recorded version so historical successors
remain replayable.

Repair-request v3 is a narrower rendering selected only when the caller supplies
a diagnostic that exactly rederives from the current bundle, stage and response;
the response is invalid; every complete diagnostic issue is `duplicate_leaf`;
the primary native error is covered; no dependent check was skipped; every
duplicated path crosses distinct child candidates; and the explicit nomination
covers every diagnosed node and candidate. The request carries only the affected
already-validated child definitions with bounded statements, conditions, product
identity and provenance refs; the current affected decisions and parent
definitions; and deterministic forbidden same-node leaf paths. Raw evidence and
source-context bodies are omitted, not summarized or presented as read. Source
roles required by the unchanged schema/consumer remain present as derived
candidate metadata. A mixed, stale, partial, clean, within-one-child, or
under-nominated diagnostic fails rather than activating the compact route. A
convergence-mode stage also fails closed: convergence retains a node only on
repeated distinct source rows, and this projection carries neither those rows
nor the compiler count that decides retention, so that failure stays on the
general repair route rather than reaching the provider blind to its own
acceptance rule.

The model chooses whether and how to split or regroup the affected meanings.
Code never selects an attachment to delete, changes a relation, authors prose, or
accepts the component in isolation. Composition still requires every affected
candidate, preserves every unaffected node, decision, label assignment and
carried field, and sends the whole successor through the unchanged native
validator. A retained or reintroduced repeated leaf therefore fails at that
native boundary. Omission of `--diagnostic` preserves general repair behavior,
including v1/v2 request replay and the lossless packed fallback. V3 adds no
normal provider call, whole-batch retry, raw-source reread, or semantic warrant.

If a scope-correct repair exposes another independent native failure, the
failure-only composer may persist that exact repair as
`LOCAL_REPAIR_COMPOSED_NOT_ACCEPTED`. The intermediate remains explicitly
unaccepted and cannot enter a selection. Its source response, repair request,
repair patch and intermediate bytes are hash-bound. An operator may pass it to
the already-existing definition or local-repair preparer for the newly visible
error; each new semantic edit still requires its own bounded judgment. Code does
not infer, clear or auto-chain a correction, and the normal path gains no call.
The same explicitly unaccepted composition is available when a scope-correct
missing-definition patch reveals a different native defect. Its failed
response, request, patch and intermediate bytes are likewise hash-bound before
the next existing bounded repair is prepared.

Current decision-only authoring also constrains terminal status and its claim
metadata as one schema choice. A nonterminal node requires both `claim_kind`
and `causal_ceiling` to be null; a terminal node requires both to use their
existing admitted values and requires `opposition_checked` to be a boolean.
This is structural compatibility, not proof that opposition was adequately
reviewed. The unchanged native consumer remains authoritative. Historical v2
response schemas and replay are unchanged.

Current decision-only prompts require a single relation for each exact
candidate-and-node pair. A candidate may attach to multiple distinct bounded
meanings, but it must not attach to the same node once as support and again as
counterevidence. The native consumer continues to reject duplicate attachment
keys regardless of relation. This prompt constraint does not mechanically prove
that the selected relation is semantically correct.

An invalid response that reused one node key for multiple definitions may enter
the same failure-only local-repair format only when that duplicate key is inside
the explicit connected nomination. The request carries every duplicate
definition and every attached candidate/source. The patch must return unique,
scope-valid replacements; code never chooses a rename or guesses which child
owned which meaning. Any duplicate outside the connected nomination blocks
preparation by name.

This is a reusable correction boundary, not prevention of every semantic error.
The v89 prompt-only dogfood (three fresh batches) still had five headcount
overstatements and zero initial native accepts. Neither structural acceptance
nor a locally corrected output establishes unobserved reader quality or
unattended reliability. Source-aware judgment must assess the new wording itself,
not assume that a prior source-row review validated a later summary.

## Admitted evidence and completeness

Completeness is bounded to the run's declared admitted evidence set. It never
claims that every raw internet item was captured. Each admitted item must have
exactly one top-level disposition:

- `claim_bearing` — one or more meaning units are emitted;
- `context_only` — useful context but no bounded proposition support;
- `out_of_scope` — outside the bound question/product/cutoff; or
- `unresolved` — meaning or binding cannot be established safely.

Every emitted semantic unit is either used by at least one proposition
relation or receives an explicit unmerged disposition. An absent alias, silent
bulk discard, or unaccounted semantic unit is incomplete. Objective upstream
metadata may define the admitted set; it may not declare that an item lacks a
competitor or material meaning merely because an exact token is absent.

Method v7 adds one independent whole-row evidence-integrity check after primary
extraction and before reconciliation. Every primary `claim_bearing` row is
checked against its exact leaf text and supplied product/parent context. The
checker returns exactly one of `accept`, complete-row `replace`, or
`unresolved`. It never emits a field patch. Deterministic code requires one
decision per primary claim-bearing evidence ID, validates any replacement
through the ordinary response validator, preserves the original raw-response
manifest, binds the verification responses in a separate manifest, and exposes
the hash of the active dispositions plus semantic units in that manifest so it
cannot be transferred onto different row content. Reconciliation sees only one
active result. Its whole-row read must keep direct
customer use, ownership, preference, and context-adopting answers first-hand;
must not assign an axis merely because a shade, product, or adjacent clause
names it; and must not invent a two-sided comparison from one side's stated
amount. It resolves leading yes/no replies against their parent question,
accounts for every materially distinct clause, and keeps unqualified preference
or better/worse language about a product overall axis-free even when it sits
beside an attribute claim. A stated liking or favorite evaluation of a named
shade uses `shade_and_color_fit`. Ownership, purchase, selection, or repurchase
of a named shade or an all/every-shade collection also carries
`shade_and_color_fit` because the observed behavior is shade-specific; this
records the behavioral subject and does not infer that the shade fit well. When
sale timing or price is expressly a condition of an intended or hypothetical
purchase, it also carries `value_and_quantity`; an incidental past sale mention
does not create that judgment.
Non-claim rows pass through unchanged.
Whole-row verification and selective repair bind decisions by explicit evidence
ID, not response-list position. Every assigned ID must occur exactly once;
missing, duplicate, foreign, and mismatched replacement identities fail.
Application follows source order, while the actual response order remains in
raw-response hash lineage. Order tolerance alone does not prove the chosen
meaning correct or change method or stage identity.
Current keyed-v3 methods v10 through v13 emit row-review response v2 for both
verification and selective repair: one required object key per assigned evidence
ID, with replacements constrained to that same ID. The public preparation
runners persist each prompt's `.schema.json`; provider execution must use it.
Native application independently rejects missing/foreign keys and misbound
replacements. Row ownership is mechanical; correct interpretation is not.
The source-work stage and its historical partition remain unchanged. Explicit
library-level response-v1 preparation reproduces historical prompts, and v1
responses remain replayable alongside v2 responses without rewriting their raw lineage. This adds
no provider stage, automatic repair, or semantic classification rule.
Publication and public-runner loading reject duplicate JSON object keys before
stage validation, including nested keyed decisions. The publisher preserves
raw response bytes and exact usage on failure; a parsed last-key-wins object
cannot establish exact participation. This decoder check proves no semantic
meaning, and valid historical responses remain unchanged.
Method v5 and v6 remain historical one-pass routes and acquire no retroactive
verification obligation.

Contract v24 versions the whole-row verifier method to v2 without changing its
response or manifest schemas. The verifier first constructs a private inventory
of standalone meanings, resolving ellipsis only from supplied context; preserves
coexisting judgments unless the source explicitly withdraws one; maps every
material meaning to the proposed units; and only then checks fields. This is an
execution order for the existing completeness doctrine, not a phrase table,
clause parser, extra response field, conclusion pass, or mandatory second
verifier. A customer attribute qualifies a result only when it states or
unambiguously entails the same baseline or the source explicitly scopes that
result to it. A possible bias, caveat, or different product response remains a
separate meaning rather than becoming the result's condition. A conjoined
attribute phrase splits: only the part whose baseline the result reports
qualifies it. Sensitivity alone establishes no moisture baseline; product-linked
sensitivity remains reaction or tolerance context, while dry or dehydrated
context may qualify moisture. Later context may narrow an earlier judgment but
never silently replace it. Every returned field must be supported by the source
or supplied context.
Historical verifier-v1 stages remain hash-distinguishable and are not relabelled
as verifier v2.

Contract v25 versions the row-verification manifest to v2 and binds the exact
verifier method version and method-text SHA-256 into the active compilation.
Every reconciliation and finalization entry point that consumes that compilation
re-checks both fields against the current method. A missing, legacy-v1,
substituted, or rehashed mismatched manifest therefore fails closed instead of
letting a stored compilation inherit current verifier authority. Historical
manifest-v1 compilations remain historical artifacts and require a fresh
row-verification application before current reconciliation. The stage and
response schemas do not change.

Contract v26 versions the whole-row verifier method to v3. When an attribute is
not retained as a result's condition, the verifier must also omit that attribute
from the result statement; it may preserve the attribute separately only when
the source separately links it to a product response, in which case that
qualified meaning must not disappear merely because it does not condition the
neighboring result. This closes the path by
which a structurally correct condition list could coexist with an overbound
sentence. Current calibration may consume a provenance-bound row-verified
compilation for a slice. The evaluator first rebuilds the primary compilation
from the pinned responses, then requires the verified manifest to cite that
exact compilation and preserve its raw-response lineage before grading the
verified rows or their reconciliation. A compilation supplied as the verified
one but carrying no row-verification manifest is rejected, not graded. A
method-v7 slice fails closed when no verified compilation is supplied; only
historical-method slices without a supplied verified compilation retain the
historical evaluation path.

Contract v28 versions the whole-row verifier method to v4 and makes correction
preserving by default. A replacement remains a complete row, but it is not a
fresh regeneration: every proposed meaning and field that the source supports
must survive, and the verifier's reason must identify any source-based removal,
change, or addition. Drying, becoming drier, loss of moisture, and non-drying
belong to `hydration_and_moisture`; burning, irritation, peeling, breakout, or
damage belong to `reaction_and_breakout`, and drying severity alone does not
move a moisture claim into reaction. A unit solely about an adjacent or
comparator product cannot bind the target product unless it states a relationship
to the target. Named-shade behavior follows the shade rule above. Historical
verifier-v3 manifests remain identifiable by their pinned verifier-v3 text but
cannot authorize current reconciliation; they must replay row verification and
are not relabelled as verifier-v4 output.

Contract v29 versions the same whole-row verifier method to v5. Its final
completeness pass maps each independently usable source meaning to exactly one
unit and maps every unit back to supported source meaning. A paired comparison
may yield a separate relational meaning only when the source establishes the
same dimension and direction on both sides; proximity alone cannot create it.
Supported adjacent-product meanings remain under their own subject. A customer
attribute qualifies a result only when it is the directly relevant baseline or
the source explicitly scopes the result to it. It becomes a separate
bound-product response only when the source explicitly identifies that product
as causing, worsening, changing, or eliciting the response; ambiguous antecedents
and vague category wording remain context. This adds no response field, second
verifier, parser, phrase table, conclusion, or recommendation. Historical
verifier-v4 manifests remain hash-identifiable but require replay before current
reconciliation or calibration.

Contract v30 versions that verifier method to v6 and closes the overcorrection
found by its first blind replay. Ambiguity in one clause cannot discard supported
unambiguous meanings elsewhere in the row. When a variant referent is genuinely
ambiguous, the verifier may retain the uncertain meaning only at the verified
shared-product scope; it cannot select a variant. An ambiguous echo remains
axis-free and detail-free rather than importing one possible parent predicate.
Variant-specific behavior cannot broaden to the whole product family, and an
explicit overall evaluation remains separate from specific attribute facts and
from a disposition reason. Whole-row unresolved remains available only when no
safe complete row exists. This adds no response field, parser, second verifier,
or conclusion surface. Historical verifier-v5 manifests remain identifiable but
require replay before current reconciliation or calibration.

Contract v31 versions the verifier method to v7 and corrects referent scope.
Pronouns, omitted subjects, and evaluation scope resolve from the whole leaf and
its supplied parent context rather than the nearest named option alone. A named
option may establish ownership or experience without narrowing every later
product evaluation to that option. Explicit ownership remains separately
visible, while the option is not copied automatically into later conditions.
Earlier extraction examples identify separate meanings but do not decide their
referent scope. This adds no variant catalog, response field, parser, second
verifier, conclusion, or full-corpus resume authority.

Contract v32 versions the verifier method to v8 and closes the two residuals
found by the four-comment delta replay. A reaction-susceptibility trait does not
by itself become a hydration baseline; a neighboring hydration result remains
unconditioned unless the source links that trait to hydration. Explicit loss,
absorption, or waste of usable product remains `value_and_quantity` evidence
even when the mechanism is a tool or texture, and it stays separately usable
when its truth can vary independently. This adds no category registry, response
field, parser, second verifier, conclusion, or full-corpus resume authority.

For method v7, `personal_agreement` may remain support for a bounded meaning but
never adds a credited independent origin and must not be described as another
first-hand customer. This is enforced both in reconciliation instructions and
in deterministic final claim-support projection. Historical semantic methods
retain their frozen output behavior.

Two boundaries of that intake are stated because they are not obvious from the
rule above. Versioning the verifier method to v3 also retires every
method-v2-verified compilation: the manifest binds the exact method version and
method-text SHA-256, so a v2-verified compilation requires a fresh
row-verification application before current reconciliation or calibration, on
the same terms v25 set for manifest-v1 artifacts. The cold-repeat lane accepts
the same provenance-bound verified-compilation shape under the reserved
`cold-repeat` slice id. It rebuilds the raw cold compilation, requires the
supplied verified manifest to cite that exact input, and grades the verified
cold rows. Method v7 requires this like-for-like verified repeat whenever cold
repeat is configured; a missing or mismatched verified cold compilation fails
closed. Historical methods may compare raw primary and raw repeat, or verified
primary and verified repeat, but never mix those lineages in one consistency
judgment.

When a captured-but-excluded denominator exists, the completion profile draws
a deterministic bounded semantic audit sample per screening family. One
load-bearing missed class reopens that family rather than licensing a passing
seal from the original screen.

Route 1.6 uses a stronger, explicitly selected profile. Its declared corpus is
the union of unique source-native items captured inside the final Phase A scope
and cutoff, not only items nominated by an earlier lexical or axis screen.
Every captured item ends as:

- `assess` — usable captured text read semantically;
- `mechanically_excluded` — excluded by a deterministic reason such as an
  exact duplicate, wrong cutoff, corrupt body, or non-text object; or
- `blocked` — required text, artifact, or material conversational context is
  unavailable.

The compiler keeps captured, assessed, mechanically excluded, and blocked
counts separate. A blocked item prevents a complete Route 1.6 view. This
full-captured-corpus profile is not silently weakened into the historical
screen-plus-audit profile. A bounded regression slice may exercise Route 1.6
mechanics, but it is not seal-eligible as a final-acquisition corpus.

## Containers, context, and capture envelopes

Leaves remain the claim-bearing evidence items. Containers preserve context
and supply a separate count dimension:

- one Reddit root plus its captured replies is one conversation container;
- one creator post plus captured audience comments is one creator-conversation
  container;
- each retailer review is one retailer-review container; and
- each PDP, owned post, advertisement, editorial item, or measured object is
  one published-object container.

Each container records captured-leaf count, source-visible total or
`unavailable`, completeness posture, capture time, and the exact capture
boundary. A claim may therefore say that support appears in seven containers
without pretending those containers are seven independent people. When an
oversized conversation is split across semantic prompts, every reply travels
with references to a context table in that prompt containing the root and
captured immediate-parent chain needed to interpret it. Shared context text is
rendered once per work unit rather than copied into every reply row.
Missing or truncated context remains visible and may force `unresolved`.

Origin counts are conservative credited-public-origin counts, not unique-person
counts. A source-scoped visible handle may receive origin credit. Exact
normalized public-handle matches across venues are treated as a possible same
actor and receive one combined credit; they never prove that the accounts are
the same person. Different visible handles may count as apparently distinct
public origins. Missing or hidden identities remain unavailable and receive no
independence credit. This identity handling is deterministic; the semantic
agent does not decide it.

## Axes and propositions

Axes are organizing questions; propositions are the specific bounded meanings
supported or opposed by evidence.

- One proposition may bind multiple existing axes.
- One evidence item may emit multiple meaning units.
- Reusing one evidence item across axes does not create another independent
  origin.
- Existing axes guide interpretation but do not cap discovery.
- An `emerging_axis_candidate` is not automatically promoted into the axis
  inventory. Before a passing seal it is either reconciled into the inventory,
  dispositioned as bounded nonmaterial, or blocks as material.

Route consumers reference proposition IDs. The integration view owns the
claim-support block. Any inline display of that block is a derived projection,
not a second authority, and must not diverge from the referenced proposition.

## Versioned interfaces

For current point selection, row-owned relations, Decision State reconciliation,
axis packing, and point/no-frontier reading, use the completion path's
[Optional evidence selection and exact quotes](../../../../../docs/workflows/phase_a_customer_evidence_completion_path_v0.md#optional-evidence-selection-and-exact-quotes)
section. Its [Active commercial point-entry boundary](../../../../../docs/workflows/phase_a_customer_evidence_completion_path_v0.md#active-commercial-point-entry-boundary)
also owns optional interrupted-attempt recovery. These current procedures retain
explicit historical replay boundaries; a legacy pack is not automatically a
current-reader input.

`semantic_evidence_bundle_v1` binds the cycle/question, current axes,
hash-pinned source artifacts, admitted normalized evidence units, source-family
denominators, method hash, stable batches, corpus hash, and bundle hash.
It remains reproducible for historical artifacts.

`semantic_evidence_bundle_v2`, selected by
`semantic_evidence_source_v2`, additionally requires at least one normalized,
`product_context` row for every admitted evidence unit. Each row cites one of
the bundle's hash-pinned `source_artifacts`; free-standing analyst context is
not admissible. The bundle binds
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v2`. The v2 method treats product
candidates as hypotheses and fails closed when text plus context cannot bind
the exact product. A v1 bundle cannot satisfy a new route-1.5.0 seal.

`semantic_evidence_batch_response_v1` is agent-authored. It accounts for every
alias and emits zero or more meaning units with precise subject, comparator,
axis, emerging-axis, and condition bindings.

`semantic_evidence_reconciliation_response_v1` is agent-authored. It groups
meaning-equivalent units into bounded propositions, records support/counter/
adjacent relations, states whether opposition was checked, and dispositions
every unused meaning unit.

`semantic_evidence_integration_view_v1` is compiler-authored. It carries final
coverage, propositions, claim-support blocks, emerging-axis candidates,
unmerged meanings, source/method/corpus bindings, and its own content hash.

Route 1.6 adds, without changing the historical interfaces above:

- `semantic_evidence_source_v3` — final-corpus scope/cutoff, container
  registry, capture envelopes, and one accounting row per captured item;
- `semantic_evidence_bundle_v3` — the normalized v3 corpus, actual rendered
  UTF-8 prompt-byte ceiling, and exact source/container/item denominators;
- `semantic_evidence_integration_method_v3` — leaf-with-container semantic
  assessment and bounded hierarchical reconciliation;
- `semantic_evidence_batch_response_v2` — semantic posture, uncertainty,
  polarity, exact product/version binding, and container-linked leaf output;
- `semantic_evidence_reconciliation_response_v2` — child-referenced semantic
  nodes, terminal claim metadata, unmerged children, and explicit emerging-axis
  consolidation; and
- `semantic_evidence_integration_view_v2` — compiler-flattened leaf lineage,
  capture-envelope accounting, evidence-item/container/origin/source-role/
  engagement counts, reverse indexes, and terminal consolidated axes.

Contract v7 adds `semantic_evidence_bundle_v4` and
`semantic_work_unit_projection_v1` without changing source v3, batch-response
v2, reconciliation-response v2, view v2, or evidence-packet v1 semantics.
Bundle v4 stores each assessable evidence row once, keeps captured accounting
as references to those rows, stores repeated context once in a hash-bound
context registry, and binds a bijective work-unit projection over the exact
assessable denominator. Every work unit carries one explicit agent-authored
disposition per assessable evidence row. Historical bundle v3 construction
remains explicitly reproducible; new full-corpus preparation defaults to v4.

Contract v8 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v2` and
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v4` for run-local product identity and
cross-source customer-evidence proof. A v2 run binds each stable product ID to
a human-readable name, source-native product IDs and aliases, and one or more
hash-pinned authority artifacts. One source-native ID or alias cannot map to
two stable products in the same run. This is a run-local identity table, not a
global product registry or a claim that similarly named variants are the same.

Method v4 retains method v3 accounting and reconciliation semantics. It adds
one product-binding rule: source-pinned stable identity controls which product
owns an experience; a different product named inside the text is a comparator,
adjacent subject, or unresolved mention unless the evidence and context
establish otherwise. Meaning-equivalent customer experience may reconcile
across community and retailer-review roles when stable product, direction,
conditions, and uncertainty are compatible. Source roles and origins remain
separate. Method v4 adds no conclusion, recommendation, prevalence estimate,
provider API, embeddings service, or campaign-evidence bridge.

Contract v9 carries that verified run-local identity table into every method-v4
final-acquisition work unit as one hash-bound `product_identity_catalog_v1`.
The catalog is vocabulary, not evidence and not an automatic classifier. A
worker still binds each Reddit body or comment from its own text plus supplied
thread and parent context; a retailer review remains owned by its product page.
One thread may therefore contain different product subjects, and one comment
may yield separate subject/comparator meanings without creating extra customer
identity credit. A missing, altered, conflicting, or authority-unbound catalog
fails before final-acquisition prompts are accepted. Bounded historical proof
sources remain reproducible without acquiring the new final-run obligation.
Catalog v1 verifies product identities but carries no verified variant
vocabulary. Catalog-backed responses therefore keep `product_version_ids`
empty and preserve variant or formula wording in the bounded statement and
conditions. A later catalog revision is required before variants may become
durable cross-leaf identities.
The verified-catalog claim applies to the sanctioned source materializer that
derives this catalog from the bound run spec. A directly hand-authored
final-acquisition source is only internally self-consistent; until the runner
binds it back to a run spec, it must not be described as spec-verified.

Contract v10 adds a separate semantic generation for full-corpus execution:
`phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v3`, `semantic_evidence_bundle_v5`,
`semantic_work_unit_projection_v2`,
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v5`,
`semantic_evidence_batch_response_v3`, and
`semantic_evidence_batch_compilation_v3`. Source v3, product identity catalog
v1, reconciliation response v2, node compilation v2, integration view v2,
evidence packet v1, and every route and seal version are unchanged. The
generations are mutually exclusive and fail closed in both directions: method
v5 requires bundle v5, bundle v5 requires method v5 or its versioned semantic
successor, and a response or
compilation from the wrong generation is rejected rather than coerced. The
legacy v4 generation remains readable, validatable, and byte-reproducible; its
paused artifacts are never mutated, restamped, migrated, or reinterpreted.

That legacy-v4 reproducibility statement does not extend universally to pre-v9
method-v4 prompt bytes. The [v9 compatibility exception](forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog)
records that v9 superseded earlier method-text hashes and that older v4 bundles
were not reproducible under the code recorded there. Inspect that exception
before replaying a bundle carrying those earlier prompt bytes.

Method v5 requires exactly one context-aware relevance and accounting judgment
for every assessable leaf, made after reading the leaf with its parent,
container, and product context. A uniquely bounded direct or referential
in-scope proposition receives detailed processing, normally `claim_bearing`.
An ambiguous referent, product, variant, formula, or proposition receives
detailed `unresolved`; ambiguity is never routed to a cheaper `out_of_scope`.
A leaf clearly established as outside the governed semantic scope may
terminate as `out_of_scope`. A leaf clearly inside the relevant context that
carries no bounded proposition once that context is read may terminate as
`context_only`. No lexical phrase blacklist, keyword relevance gate, or length
rule is permitted. Context may resolve an omitted referent or predicate, but it
cannot donate an attribute or axis. Generic approval or dislike remains
`context_only` when context supplies only the product. A reply that uniquely
adopts a bounded parent complaint, comparison, behavior, preference, product
choice, condition, or variant remains detailed. For example, in the chain
`which is your favorite?` -> `Vanilla Beige!` -> `My fav!`, the final reply
adopts the Vanilla Beige preference; it is not an empty reaction.

Referential agreement uses the `personal_agreement` posture and does not
inherit the parent's first-hand experience. When a distinctly credited reply
actually asserts the same bounded proposition, it may contribute that actor's
same-thread recurrence under the intelligence claim-support contract. Bare
agreement is low-information recurrence: it adds no reason, attribute, axis,
condition, or explanatory detail. A reply such as `same` adopts only the
clearly targeted bounded meaning; it does not silently adopt every clause of a
multi-point parent. The shared thread remains disclosed and cannot earn
cross-venue credit. A reply that merely repeats or reports the parent remains
`attribution_or_echo` and adds no independent origin. Bounded variant or formula wording stays detailed
while catalog v1 keeps `product_version_ids` empty; ambiguous variant or
formula binding is detailed `unresolved`.

Contract v21 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v4` and
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v6`. Method v6 deliberately reuses
bundle v5, projection v2, batch response v3, compilation v3, reconciliation
response v2, view v2, and evidence packet v1. It changes semantic instructions,
not transport or durable evidence shape. Method v5 text and historical outputs
remain hash-distinct and reproducible; a run must explicitly select method v6.

Method v6 preserves the complete meaning of each leaf before deciding how to
split it. It keeps explicit causal and explanatory links in the statement that
they qualify. It may keep connected ownership and habitual-use behavior in one
truth-complete statement when that is what the author expressed, but it never
turns quantity owned into a purchase count or a verified repurchase. Axis
assignment follows the whole outcome and direction, not an isolated symptom
word: healing pre-existing dryness or peeling is hydration/repair, while
product-caused or product-worsened irritation remains reaction. Named shade
selection, ownership, or preference may carry `shade_and_color_fit` without
inventing a reason such as undertone or complexion fit.

Contract v22 versions the semantic-calibration adjudication ruler separately
from the extraction method. New preparation receipts and reports carry the
ruler's stable ID and full SHA-256. Evaluation accepts only exact known ruler
hashes, binds a new receipt to its sidecar, and rejects an unknown or substituted
ruler. Historical preparation-v1 and report-v1 artifacts retain their original
shape and hashes; they are not rewritten to claim the new binding.

Contract v23 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v5` and
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v7`. Method v7 keeps method v6 extraction
rules and the existing bundle/response/compilation/reconciliation/view
transports. Its new execution obligation is the hash-bound whole-row check
described above. An unverified compilation may still reproduce historical v5
or v6 behavior, but method v7 reconciliation and finalization fail closed until
the verification manifest is present and valid.

Contract v74 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v6` and
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v8` for current authoring. Method v8
keeps method v7 meaning rules, row verification, bundle v5, projection v2,
compilation v3, reconciliation, views, and packets. It changes only the raw
batch-response transport: every expected evidence ID is an exact required key
under `decisions_by_evidence_id`, and the value contains that row's disposition,
reason, and semantic units without repeating the ID. The per-batch provider
schema is derived from immutable work-unit membership, written beside the
prompt or execution pack, hash-bound in the pack manifest, and rejects missing,
foreign, or repeated identities before semantic compilation. This adds no
provider call and no semantic rule. Historical run v5 / method v7 artifacts
retain response v3 grouped replay and are never silently reinterpreted as keyed
responses.

Contract v75 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v7`,
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v9`, and keyed response transport v2.
They preserve method v8 meaning and keyed identity while moving one already
deterministic impossibility into the per-row provider schema:
`personal_agreement` is unavailable when the immutable evidence row carries no
parent-context reference. Rows with supplied parent context retain the posture.
The ordinary validator still rejects the same impossible combination after
generation; the schema now prevents it before token-consuming output is
accepted. Historical method v8 / keyed transport v1 schemas and responses
remain replayable under their original execution identity.

Contract v76 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v8`,
`semantic_evidence_integration_method_v10`, and keyed response transport v3.
They preserve v9 semantics and posture restrictions while requiring at least
one cataloged `subject_product_id` in every semantic unit at the provider
schema boundary. This mirrors the longstanding compilation validator and does
not infer, select, or repair a subject. Historical method v9 / keyed transport
v2 schemas and responses remain replayable under their original identity.

Contract v77 adds `semantic_evidence_row_verification_method_v9` and makes
response transport stage-local. The keyed `decisions_by_evidence_id` rule is
rendered only for the initial semantic batch surface that owns that schema; it
is omitted from row verification, targeted audit, and reconciliation prompts,
which retain their own response shapes. This removes contradictory response
instructions without changing semantic policy, adding a provider call, or
rewriting historical row-verifier v8 text.

Owner-authorized replay correction (2026-09-07): a completed row-verification
manifest may retain the exact verifier-v8 version and policy hash where the
bundle's current verifier is v9. V9 changes transport instructions, not semantic
policy. Replay preserves the original manifest, compilation, and output bytes;
it does not certify a v9 execution. All active-row and response-lineage checks
still apply. A row-repair manifest may carry the frozen v8 identity only when
its parent row-verification manifest carries it; a v9 verification still
requires a v9 repair, while a v9 repair authored over a frozen v8 verification
stays valid. New verification continues to author v9; integration methods v11
through v13 still require their own v10 through v12 verifiers. Older verifier policies,
unknown hashes, or a version/hash substitution remain rejected.

Contract v78 adds `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v9` and integration method
v11, retaining keyed transport v3, required subjects, and row-owned posture
restrictions. Method v11 pairs with row-verification method v10; historical
integration methods keep verifier v9. Current extraction, verification, targeted
audit, repair, and reconciliation prose names semantic concepts instead of
hard-coded example axis IDs. This corrects an observed Dieux prompt/inventory
mismatch; it is not evidence that the mismatch caused the provider timeout or
that latency or semantic quality improved.

Contract v80 adds run v10 / integration method v12 / verifier v11 without
changing keyed transport v3 or adding a provider stage. Explicit overall
evaluations survive as separate axis-free meanings; independently retrievable
attributes remain separate, qualifications stay attached, and an explicitly
stated reason remains attached to the behavior it explains. Verification checks
each unit before accepting the row rather than presuming the proposal correct.
These are semantic duties, not deterministic guarantees. Current-policy
readiness still requires the existing calibration and cold-repeat proof.
Historical integration v5-v11 and verifier v10 prompt bytes remain unchanged.

Calibration reopening retains producer-derived prompt metadata (including a
keyed response schema) while reading the actual saved prompt bytes. An altered
saved primary or cold prompt still fails at the prompt-identity boundary. This
loader repair changes neither the provider answer nor its semantic judgment.

When one leaf evaluates two alternatives on the same attribute, the relative
comparison remains evidence even if the observations occupy separate
sentences. A context-adopting reply keeps a parent's named-shade preference and
shade axis. Physical thickness, viscosity, or feel remains a texture outcome
when a formula is merely the comparator; formula consistency requires an
actual formula identity, change, or resemblance. Generic ingredient or
category nicknames do not establish an exact catalog product without a bound
alias or resolving context. Negative behavior stays logically negated unless
the statement is rewritten as an exact positive equivalent without retaining
the negative clause. An asserted desire remains affirmed even when it exposes
an unmet product attribute. A nearby preference supplies no reason, axis, or
comparison unless the source explicitly connects them.

Explicit contrast wording does not override atomicity. Independently testable
material sides stay separate and opposite directions are not bundled. Preserve
an explicit overall approval as its own axis-free meaning; do not infer a
specific product benefit from it. Historical prompts that discarded generic
approval are not the current authoring instruction.
Qualifications follow the same atomicity rule. This narrows the
meaning-preservation rule without weakening its causal, explanatory, or
connected-behavior cases.

A customer attribute may qualify a result when its meaning makes the attribute
relevant; an explicit causal phrase is not mandatory, but mere proximity is
insufficient. Non-worsening dryness is bounded hydration evidence rather than
proof of strong hydration. Product category, experienced category, price/value,
and attribute performance remain separate meanings unless the leaf explicitly
connects them. An unconsolidated semantic unit is not unimportant: it stays
retrievable with provenance unless deterministically dispositioned under the
existing rules. These clarifications add no score, high-value-comment
classifier, phrase table, second semantic pass, provider API, recommendation,
or conclusion.

Evidence posture describes how a leaf supports its unit, not whether its verb
sounds like an action or plan. A customer's own purchase, use, return, reach,
repurchase, or stated purchase intent is `first_hand`. `strategy_statement` is
reserved for company, creator, or other organizational strategy; it never
relabels customer shopping or use behavior.

Every atomic `statement` remains truthful when read without its structured
fields. Logical negation such as `not` and `never`, and comparative ordering
such as `less`, stay in the statement; `polarity` repeats the statement's
logical assertion form and never supplies or reverses words omitted from the
statement. A directly asserted comparison such as `A is less moisturising than
B` is `affirmed`: `less` carries comparative ordering, not logical negation.
`A is not as moisturising as B` is `negated`. Subject and comparator roles plus
the complete wording carry the comparison's direction. A support child and terminal
`bounded_meaning` have compatible direction. A negated child may validly be
`counter` to the inverse positive meaning, but it may never support that
positive meaning. `meaning_direction_preserved` adjudication checks the child,
relation, and terminal wording together.

Every detailed leaf is decomposed into the smallest complete set of atomic
meanings. Meanings that can be independently true, or differ in product, axis,
behavior, comparison, condition, polarity, or posture, remain separate; a
condition stays with the proposition it qualifies. Axis candidates provide
vocabulary only. Each assigned axis must be semantically supported by the
atomic unit and leaf; context may resolve a referent but cannot donate an axis.
Generic approval embedded beside a bounded judgment is absent from the atomic
statement: `good, but not worth $24` yields only `not worth $24`, never one
mixed-direction unit. A leading yes/no reply retains the exact predicate of
the parent question and its own qualification. Ownership is preserved as
behavior and remains separate from a conditional future purchase. Thus `I
have Poppy` and `would get it only on sale` are distinct atoms. Different
hydration truths also remain distinct: `not the most hydrating` does not absorb
`does not make lips drier`. Every explicit contrast in a two-product passage
remains present, including a hydration contrast stated through the comparator
and a separate target non-sinking claim when both are expressed. `More like a
gloss than a balm` is an axis-free category judgment unless the leaf separately
states a texture attribute.

Logical polarity repeats the statement's assertion form: `not the most
hydrating` and `does not make lips drier` are negated even though the author
affirms that those statements are true. Direct `less` or `more` comparisons are
affirmed when asserted without logical negation; their lower or higher ordering
remains explicit in the statement and product roles. Calibration field
`statement_direction_supported` judges source entailment of that complete
direction and polarity consistency, not sentiment or whether the comparison is
favorable. `Worsens peeling` carries
`reaction_and_breakout`; not-drying alone carries hydration, not reaction.
Bare ownership, quantity owned, and go-to behavior are axis-free unless a
separate attribute is stated; named shade ownership remains the accepted
shade-axis exception.

An `attribution_or_echo` unit's standalone statement names the attribution; the
posture field cannot carry words omitted from an otherwise first-hand-sounding
sentence. A shade-ownership unit carries `shade_and_color_fit`. `I have the
Poppy flavor` is an ownership atom, while `reaches for other formulas` is an
affirmed switching behavior rather than a negated target-use statement.

For bundle v5 reconciliation, each candidate carries its exact set of leaf
evidence postures through every level. The prompt exposes that set, and level
validation rejects `customer_experience` or `reported_behavior` terminal proof
when any supporting posture is not `first_hand` or `personal_agreement`.
`strategy_statement` is routed as `actor_strategy`. This check occurs before
finalization so a known impossible claim-kind/posture combination cannot spend
another level or masquerade as a valid node compilation.

Reconciliation must expose conflict and exact agreement, not merely keep their
leaves somewhere in the view. When opposite experiences address the same
bounded proposition, the opposing child is linked as `counter` rather than
emitted only as a second support-only proposition with `none_observed`
conflict. An exact `first_hand` preference and a distinct actor's
`personal_agreement` may support one bounded proposition while preserving both
actors, postures, and shared-thread provenance.

After a leaf is validly classified as terminal `context_only` or clearly
established `out_of_scope`, it incurs no bespoke extraction, semantic-unit
construction, axis assignment, reconciliation candidacy, proposition
rewriting, or downstream evidence-packet delivery. The unavoidable cost per
leaf remains loading it with its necessary context, making the one
meaning-aware judgment, and publishing its exact evidence ID under an explicit
terminal disposition.

Batch response v3 carries two explicit populations: detailed evidence records
and terminal disposition groups. `claim_bearing` and `unresolved` are always
detailed. `context_only` and `out_of_scope` may be grouped only when every
listed leaf has already been contextually judged eligible and they genuinely
share one disposition and one semantic reason; a nuanced or singleton terminal
judgment may remain detailed. Each group carries an ordered, explicit evidence-ID
list and one agent-authored reason. Grouping is response transport compression:
there is no implicit remainder, default disposition, wildcard, exclusion
filter, omitted-ID behavior, sample, or semantic census. Raw response v3 is the
durable agent-authored artifact of record.

Raw evidence-ID occurrences are validated before any dictionary or set is
constructed, so a duplicate cannot be masked by collapsing: no duplicate inside
one group, none across groups, no overlap between grouped and detailed records,
no unexpected ID, and an exact union with the work unit's expected IDs. Only
then is the response deterministically expanded into the normalized
one-row-per-evidence-ID representation existing validation consumes. Expansion
preserves every original evidence ID, its disposition and reason, and the
bundle's immutable source text, context references, product bindings, and
provenance; it emits rows in expected work-unit order, fails closed on
malformed, duplicated, missing, or unexpected identifiers, and never
deduplicates silently.

Deterministic expansion must not erase the identity of the raw response-v3
artifacts. Batch compilation v3 binds the exact accepted response set through
canonical raw-response hashes in a deterministic sorted manifest. The compiled
semantic representation may remain expanded, but its lineage proves which
durable raw grouped responses produced it, and downstream reconciliation
rejects a compilation v3 that lacks that lineage.

The keyed response transport is the current-authoring replacement for response
v3 grouping, not a new evidence model. Transport v2 also removes
`personal_agreement` from a row's allowed posture enum when that row has no
supplied parent context; it does not choose a replacement posture or infer the
row's meaning. The keyed transport removes the model-authored task of
copying identifiers into rows or terminal groups: the provider must fill one
already named object slot per expected evidence ID. Deterministic normalization
then produces the same one-row-per-evidence representation consumed by
compilation v3. Exact membership, source text, context, product binding,
provenance, and raw-response hashes remain unchanged obligations. Grouped
response v3 remains supported only when the bound historical method identity
requires it.

Projection v2 binds semantic execution identity: source, corpus, and catalog
bindings; the selected method v5, v6, v7, or v8 identity and hash; response-schema
version; prompt-encoding
version; exact work-unit membership; evidence and context references; prompt and
leaf caps; and complete assessable-denominator coverage. It must not encode a
worker count or static worker partition, because who executes a work unit is a
controller runtime decision, not part of semantic identity. The new generation
keeps the existing pretty, indented JSON prompt encoding, bound by name so a
later compact encoding cannot silently reuse a projection packed under this one.

Contract v33 adds an optional `semantic_prompt_execution_pack_v1` transport for
long-lived workers. It stores the method, response shape, axes, and product
catalog in one hash-bound shared frame and stores each work unit's exact context
table and evidence rows in a separately hashed payload. Every payload must
reconstruct the existing standalone prompt byte-for-byte before it is usable;
the bundle, method, response, compilation, work-unit, prompt ceiling, and
evidence-accounting identities do not change. Context remains batch-local in
v1 because exposing neighboring context or relying on model memory would change
the judgment surface and requires separate calibration. The pack is execution
transport only: it adds no static worker topology, provider API, semantic cache,
evidence filter, or resume/readiness claim.

The reconstruction target is the rendered standalone prompt string that batch
prompt building already produces, not the `prompts/<batch_id>.md` file the
standalone preparation route writes. The rendered string is the canonical
model-facing prompt and the prompt-ceiling input. The file writer appends one
trailing newline as a storage delimiter, so a reconstructed prompt is exactly
one byte shorter than the corresponding stored `.md` artifact. Byte-for-byte
reconstruction is asserted against the canonical rendered string; consumers
that deliberately submit raw `.md` file bytes also submit that storage newline.

Pack verification is bundle-relative and exclusive, not self-proving. It
regenerates the frame, manifest, and payloads from the originating bundle,
compares them to freshly read stored bytes, requires the stored file set to be
exactly the frame, the manifest, and one payload per named work unit, and
re-runs reconstruction on each freshly parsed payload because a hash over
canonical JSON cannot see the key order that prompt bytes depend on. Without
the originating bundle the pack proves nothing; the reported stored-byte total
and reduction cover exactly that verified file set. A batch id must be one safe
path component, since it names the stored payload file. The pack carries no
model call, and no observed latency change is attributed to it.

For the new generation the controller verifies the immutable bundle and
projection once per invocation and reuses that verified context across all
response validation in that invocation. Status reports global expected,
accepted, staged, invalid, and missing work-unit state; it reports no static
worker partitions, and the legacy partition report remains only on the
projection-v1 path. The global missing-work list is the repository interface
consumed by the invoking controller. Any active assignment bookkeeping belongs
only to that controller's in-memory execution state; this contract installs no
repository scheduler or otherwise-unused assignment API. Deterministic atomic
no-overwrite publication remains the only durable truth boundary, and
publication collisions plus invalid or staged artifacts stay visible rather
than silently successful. No daemon, queue database, lease protocol, heartbeat,
persistent claim-marker system, persistent verification cache, new registry,
automated loser deletion, or response winner selection is introduced.

High-watermark repacking, larger prompt or leaf caps, persistent
method/catalog/context transport, compact prompt JSON, a two-stage semantic
census, additional worker infrastructure, and reconciliation redesign remain
out of this generation. Contract v10 adds no provider API, no semantic
calibration, no latency or token claim, and no route or seal obligation.

`build-product-axis-proof-source` creates a bounded regression source from an
already materialized full source by selecting the complete captured union for
one stable product and one or more exact axes. It replaces mapped source IDs
with the stable run ID, retains source-native context, and rejects lexical
mentions on pages bound to a different product. Its output is never a
final-acquisition corpus. Route 1.6 and 1.7 passing-seal requirements remain on
method v3 until an explicit later route revision adopts method v4; a v4 shadow
or proof cannot silently satisfy those historical obligations.

`phase_a_evidence_packet_v1` is a read-only projection from one finalized
`semantic_evidence_integration_view_v2`, its bound v3 bundle, and its bound
batch and terminal-node compilations. The projector first rebuilds the supplied
view from those inputs, preventing an altered semantic statement from being
paired with a valid view. It is the tail-end retrieval surface for Phase A evidence,
not another evidence authority or another closure job. A caller selects either
one or more exact proposition IDs or one or more exact axis IDs. When a caller
starts from a natural-language question, an agent interprets that meaning and
chooses the relevant IDs from the finalized view; deterministic code then
expands those IDs without a keyword or top-k cutoff.

The packet returns every distinct linked evidence item once, while preserving
all proposition/relation/semantic-unit links. Each linked semantic unit retains
its evidence posture, uncertainty posture, and polarity; accepted relations do
not lose qualifications that remain visible on unmerged material. It reports
the complete selected union of support, counter, and adjacent evidence,
container and independent-origin counts, the selected containers with their
capture boundaries, and any
axis-relevant unmerged or unresolved candidates. It also reports the complete
corpus unmerged denominator and returns unscoped unmerged meanings separately,
so an emerging-label meaning with no accepted axis cannot disappear from every
packet. Per-relation evidence counts are non-disjoint unions: one item may
support one selected proposition and oppose another. One
item supporting multiple propositions or axes remains one evidence item. The
packet binds the source view, bundle, both compilation hashes, and corpus hash.
It fails closed on unknown IDs, stale lineage, or inconsistent reverse indexes.

The packet contains bounded propositions only as retrieval labels. It does not
carry a conclusion, recommendation, importance ranking, prevalence estimate,
or causal judgment. Deliver may use the packet as evidence input but owns any
downstream conclusion. A changed corpus invalidates the source view and every
packet derived from it. The projection uses no provider API, embeddings,
vector store, or new persistent index.

Contract v35 adds `phase_a_evidence_packet_v2` as the default output of the
existing `project-evidence-packet` route. It preserves v1 selection, lineage,
coverage, and fail-closed rebuilding, but changes the model-facing layout. Each
admitted linked, unmerged, unscoped-unmerged, or unresolved evidence item
appears once in a source-grouped catalogue. A source group owns the repeated
source family, source role, engagement metric kind, and source-specific
engagement context; each evidence row retains its raw engagement value,
observation time, materiality observation, actor and independence data,
publication time, source reference, container reference, and the selected
semantic units. Each proposition carries only relation-to-evidence and
relation-to-semantic-unit references. Full evidence text and parent/product
context remain resolvable by `evidence_id` from the hash-bound bundle and are
not duplicated inline.

The catalogue has no evidence-count cap and no top-k admission rule. Source
grouping is presentation and transport normalization only; it does not merge
actors, platforms, source roles, meanings, engagement units, or proposition
relations. `phase_a_evidence_packet_v1` remains available only through the
explicit legacy packet-version route for historical reproduction. Contract
v35 made v2 the no-flag runner default; contract v36 below supersedes that
default while retaining explicit v2 reproduction.

Contract v36 makes `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3` the normal output. V3 is a
lossless transport projection over v2: repeated evidence, engagement, and
semantic-unit field names are declared once as explicit named columns, while
values common to every row in a packet or source group are declared once as
named defaults at that exact scope. Remaining positional values map to those
human-readable column names. Evidence IDs and semantic-unit references remain
literal, proposition relations remain explicit, and source-group headers still
own source-native engagement meaning. This is normalization, not abbreviation
or evidence selection.

Before v3 is returned or hashed, the projector reconstructs the expected
column/default layout from v2 and rejects any changed top-level payload,
source-group evidence row, or proposition relation. V2 remains available
through the explicit packet-version route as the matched comparison baseline;
v1 remains historical reproduction. The normal runner needs no new operator
step, lookup, or retrieval round.

Contract v37 changes only the downstream evidence-consumer protocol. The
packet remains `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3`. A no-provider prepare operation
may place proposition cases in one ordered decision batch only when their
packets bind the same corpus and bundle and their proposition relations share
evidence. Unrelated cases remain separate calls. The model returns only its
synthesis judgment and literal support/counter refs; it does not recopy
engagement, provenance, actor identity, dates, excerpts, relation inventories,
or resolution facts. A hash-bound manifest preserves exact case and
proposition order and the original packet/selector identities.

The no-provider finalize operation rejects missing, duplicate, shuffled, or
foreign case/proposition results and refs before deterministically reattaching
the source-owned rows and inventories. It reconstructs v3 named defaults and
positional columns, including source-native engagement and
`public_identity_key`, and fails on a missing lookup, wrong row attachment, or
malformed engagement posture. Preparation and finalization make zero model API
calls; an external fresh agent still consumes the emitted prompt and response
schema. This is call-overhead amortization plus deterministic rehydration, not
packet compression, evidence selection, a caching claim, or a new judgment
authority.

Contract v39 adds an optional no-provider selection-and-quote consumer over
one or more hash-bound v3 packets. It does not change packet v3 or the
authoritative semantic view. Admission is deterministic from explicit product
and axis membership or literal operator-nominated semantic/unresolved refs.
Current authoring uses selection spec v2 with explicit `point_actor_scope`:
source-local reports or an identified actor bound to a credited literal point
anchor by source ID and independence key. The completion path's paragraph
beginning `Fresh selections use` owns the operational shape and CLI route.
Both existing judgment exchanges receive the scope and row origin identity;
both reader surfaces preserve it unchanged. Deterministic code verifies the
identity and transfer, not whether the authored scope fits the source meaning.
Under source-local reports the input source ID is not a person identifier.
Read source-bound independence keys with their independence posture and
source-visible attribution; different keys alone do not prove different
people. Check origin overlap before describing opposed rows as separate
authors. One credited origin can appear on both sides; preserve its separate
observations without inferring conflict or refinement from identity alone.
Different people's opposed preferences do not disprove a particular person's
private state. Frozen selection spec v1 replay keeps its original scope
semantics; it is not fresh authoring and gains no default.
Current scoped specs may carry the completion path's inline
`phase_a_relation_adjudication_v2` exception input. It preserves an explicit
bounded judgment on an unchanged point/source/inventory/policy basis across
confirmation reruns, retaining the raw answers, prior binding, replacement
binding, and all changed labels. The semantic finalizer locates exactly the
authored prior row-owned ref set, requires the replacement refs to be owned by
that same evidence row, and then applies only the authored refs,
relation, and reason. It does not infer semantic correctness or select refs.
Missing, duplicate, foreign, or stale corrections fail visibly. The builder
and readers still only preserve and verify attachments, never settle meaning.
The record travels with the current spec; no machine-local locator or historical
adapter is part of the current authoring contract. Projection-field changes are
judging-policy changes and invalidate reuse; row order and batching do not.
An external response must label every admitted candidate exactly once as
support, counter, adjacent, or exclude before presentation selection begins;
missing, duplicate, foreign, reordered, and wrong-role rows fail closed at
response validation, and wrong-product nomination fails closed earlier at
admission. An operator nomination that cannot resolve — an `admit_semantic_ref`,
an `admit_unresolved` ref, a protected evidence ID, or an unrecognised protected
lane key — fails closed rather than being dropped. All dispositions and their
inventory hash remain in the completed artifact, including rows not displayed.
Every candidate also carries the other normalized meanings from its evidence
item as non-candidate context. Those companions cannot create another admitted
row or independent origin, but they prevent an isolated clause from hiding a
same-source qualification. In particular, a price-discomfort clause does not
become poor-value support when the same customer records purchase or repurchase
despite that price. A value selection binds `price feels high` separately from
`not worth it`; operator-observed purchase, repurchase, switching, return, or
abandonment that changes the reading uses the existing `costly_behavior`
protected-evidence lane rather than a new score.

Presentation caps independent origins, not underlying evidence. One selection
is one bounded evidence point, not one broad axis. The default is at most
thirteen customer truth-support origin groups per point; a selection may
explicitly bind a customer cap from one through twenty when protected evidence
or a material conflict cannot fit. Creator influence remains capped separately
at three and cannot consume or enlarge the customer cap. A raised cap is
selection-specific rather than a new global default. The earlier measured
full-axis Summer Fridays hydration selection bound fifteen and remains a
historical comparison artifact; new presentation runs split the broad axis into
bounded points instead of treating fifteen origins as one axis-wide pack.
Every explicitly nominated safety or costly-behavior origin is selected first;
if those origins alone exceed the bound customer cap, selection fails
`presentation_cap_insufficient`. The selector then reserves support and counter
only from materially positive or explicitly protected evidence; that reservation
is subject to the same cap check, so a protected set that fits the cap only until
the support and counter lanes are reserved also fails
`presentation_cap_insufficient` rather than dropping a required origin. Unprotected
zero, quiet, and engagement-unavailable rows remain accounted but are not forced
into the main display to fill a lane or venue. When no materially positive or
protected counter exists, no counter is displayed. The cap check follows every
addition. Each protected origin records its required display lanes, and the
display contains the deterministic minimum member rows that cover them. Every
operator-protected row is visible or selection fails closed. Unreserved origins
retain the compact representative-plus-distinct-row behavior over the
display-eligible set. The complete disposition inventory remains the accounting
record for displayed and undisplayed candidates.
Engagement orders rows only inside one source-native venue/role/metric bucket;
its literal stored value remains unchanged and there is no cross-platform
score. Venue is normalized per publisher across host variants and short links,
so one publisher cannot split into several display sections or ordering
buckets. A source-native value the runtime cannot read as a whole number — an
abbreviated or group-separated count — is treated as uncomparable and ordered
last rather than partially parsed. Mapping-valued engagement is accepted only
for an exactly recognized source-native engagement kind and shape; any other
mapping fails `unsupported_engagement_shape` rather than becoming an unknown or
generic score. A distinct relation or condition from the same origin may
receive another displayed quote without consuming another origin slot.
Creator-authored material is influence context and is
deterministically barred from customer support or counter relations; qualified
creator-audience comments retain their customer role.

Only selected display rows expose their source bodies to the quote finalizer.
Current v10 authoring makes no quote provider call: it copies each available
selected row's complete bound source body and rejects any attached quote
response. This removes model transcription, clipping, and cross-row quote
transfer from current authoring. It proves complete row/body transfer, not that
the selected source or judgment-authored relation is semantically adequate.
The bundle is content-verified against its own stored
`bundle_sha256` where it enters the trust boundary, and the finalizer follows
the packet's bundle hash to its literal evidence ID, requires exact
source-artifact and source-ref equality, and rejects a body whose hash differs
from the one the quote manifest recorded. Missing source bodies remain explicit
as `quote_unavailable` with `source_body_unavailable`; linked parent context is
separate reading context and never substitutes for or splices into the row body.
Historical v9 authoring retains its stable row-owned token transport and
provider response. Historical v9 and v8 use the 220-character threshold only
for short-body copying and external-review workload selection, never as a
semantic ceiling. Historical token or text transports retain their exactness,
substance, relevance, and context-completeness rules under their stamped
versions. For historical v4/v5/v6/v7/v8 quote manifests, a long-body quote
that ends in an alphanumeric
character while the bound source continues with whitespace and another
alphanumeric character fails at `quote_boundary_incomplete`; this deterministic
check prevents an exact but mid-phrase span from silently satisfying the
context-complete contract. Historical v9 does not apply that prose heuristic after
token-span selection: deterministic enforcement owns exact row/body/token
attachment, while semantic completeness remains explicitly not mechanically
proven. Historical provider routes retain the distinction between
`source_body_unavailable` and `no_relevant_exact_quote_returned`. Current v10
has only the former unavailable cause because every present selected body is
copied in full. Each displayed row records `source_body_present`, and the
source-owned normalized meaning and same-evidence companion meanings remain in
all cases. The current prepare/finalize stage makes zero provider calls and is
deterministic and
idempotent.

For a large non-value selection, positional relation transport may be split
into hash-bound batches of at most 300 candidates. Each response is an object
carrying the required single-valued `batch_id` of the batch it answers, plus
required named `row_NNNN` properties that map to the zero-based candidate
positions in that batch and whose values are only support, counter, adjacent,
or exclude. It repeats neither candidate IDs nor free-text reason codes.
Because row keys restart at `row_0000` in every batch, `batch_id` is what makes
a response answerable by exactly one batch: without it two same-size batches
would share one schema and one interchangeable response, and a transposed or
stale response would finalize with complete-looking coverage and systematically
wrong relations. Finalization validates the batch-manifest hash, source and
candidate hashes, the exact batch set, contiguous complete coverage, each
response's own batch identity, and the exact required row key set before
deterministically reattaching literal candidate identities. Any missing,
foreign, or wrong-batch response, and any missing or foreign row, fails closed
before presentation selection.

Positional transport buys that failure visibility by giving up the
model-authored reason code. A batched row therefore carries a reason label
derived deterministically from its relation alone — one fixed label per
relation — not a code naming the evidence meaning. That label is the relation
restated, so a batched pack's row labels distinguish relations but not
meanings, and any consumer that reads a reason code or display label as source
meaning is reading a weaker signal than the literal-ID path supplies. Relation
authority, semantic admission, candidate identity, and the exact-quote
requirement are unchanged. The transport is unavailable for value selections,
whose relation-aligned vocabulary remains literal-ID based.

Policy guidance is a property of the whole selection, not of a transport slice:
every batch prompt carries the guidance derived from the complete admitted
candidate inventory, so a batch cannot acquire a policy lane the selection as a
whole rejected.

Batched quote preparation versions its durable output as
`phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v6`. It retains the v5 binding of the exact relation
batch-manifest hash, batch count, and one canonical response hash per batch.
The embedded selection manifest remains the canonical full-selection identity;
its single-prompt hash is not an execution receipt. The v5 transport binding is
the authority for which relation prompts and responses actually produced the
selected quote workload. Removing or changing that binding changes the manifest
hash and fails quote finalization.

Every v6 point pack also requires a separate selected-row relation confirmation
before quote finalization. V7 is the route for a frontier-bound point pack; the
non-frontier `finalize-evidence-selection-relations` and
`finalize-evidence-selection-batches` routes still stamp v6, so this obligation
is live for those packs and is not reproduction-only. The confirmation prompt contains only
the bounded point plus each selected row's source-owned meaning, conditions,
product/version scope, source role, and same-evidence companion meanings. It
does not expose the first-pass relation, reason code, display label, engagement,
or selection priority. Withholding selection priority is structural, not a
prompt request: selection order leads with protected and reserved
support/counter origins and always trails with the adjacent creator-influence
block, so the confirmation rows carry opaque `confirmation_row_id` handles and
are presented in a content-derived order keyed to the bound selected-row
identities. That order is deterministic and reproduces on re-preparation, so
the pass stays replayable without carrying the first pass into it. The
confirmation response must account for every confirmation row exactly once and
in order. Any missing, duplicate, foreign, reordered, or differently labeled
row fails closed; neither pass silently wins. The confirmation manifest is
re-derived from the bound quote manifest at finalization, so a hand-written
manifest cannot vouch for a workload that was shown the first-pass labels.
The same response must classify `bounded_point` as either `single_point` or
`broad_axis_or_bundle` and give a short reason. `single_point` means one
specific direction-bearing proposition about one material product attribute or
outcome under one compatible condition set. Merely naming an experience area,
or combining materially different attributes, outcomes, directions, or
conditions, fails at `bounded_point_not_confirmed`. This reuses the existing
confirmation call; it adds no third provider workload.
Quote extraction remains a separate response so relation checking cannot make
the quote task clip or omit source context. Historical v1/v3/v4/v5 manifests
remain finalizable under their stamped contracts and never acquire this new
obligation; one is finalized with no confirmation attachment at all, and
supplying one fails closed at `unexpected_relation_confirmation`.

Current Decision State consolidation is delta-based when a new point layout
regroups already judged evidence. `prepare-decision-state-reconciliation` pins
the current axis packs and templates plus the chosen historical specs. It may
reuse a Decision State judgment only for an unchanged source-owned semantic
identity consisting of evidence ID, semantic-unit ref, literal normalized
statement, axes, conditions, and polarity, and only when every matching prior
observation carries the same complete judgment bundle. Point ID, selected-row
ID, row order, axis placement, and relation are not semantic reuse keys. Because
current v4 rows address meanings by semantic ref, one evidence and semantic-ref
slot must resolve to a single current identity across every axis in the run; two
current axes carrying different content for the same slot fail closed rather
than silently resolving to one of them. New or changed identities, conflicting
history, and partial multi-ref state groups are the only units sent to the
existing bounded judgment boundary. That boundary describes the actor rather
than turning every product outcome into a state. Its current prompt uses
`expectation_judgment` only for explicit expectation, hype, skepticism,
surprise, disappointment, or underwhelming language; uses
`preference_judgment` only for an explicit evaluative or suitability judgment;
keeps other product attributes and observed outcomes as context; does not infer
acquisition from price or quantity; and does not infer use from ownership or
carrying. Carrying or keeping a product nearby is context unless ownership or
use is explicit. Commercial direction is relative to the preserved decision
object: a preference for A over B keeps the full comparison as a favorable
object, while an exact midpoint numeric rating is mixed absent another stated
direction. One atomic statement with separable explicit states emits each state
rather than hiding a state in conditions or collapsing the bundle into mixed.
`finalize-decision-state-reconciliation` requires exact coverage of those
unresolved identities, compiles complete current v4 Decision State bindings,
and validates the ordinary consolidation consumer. Current row-owned relation
refs remain point-relative and are copied only from the current v3 selection
artifact. This adds no third provider stage: a run with no unresolved identities
needs no model call, while a run with deltas judges only those deltas. The
manifest is a hash-bound run receipt, not a global semantic registry, ontology,
or independently writable evidence authority. Exact historical agreement proves
mechanical reuse eligibility, not semantic truth; bounded review retains the
right to challenge an old judgment.

New Decision State reconciliation manifests use v2 to select the clarified
action/time instructions: reported current use is not proof of repurchase;
earlier interest survives later trial; returning merchandise differs from
resuming use. Historical v1 manifests remain valid and retain their original
prompt when batched. This version selects wording only: the adjudication schema,
reuse rules, coverage checks and consolidation consumer stay unchanged.

When the unresolved prompt exceeds a provider or operator-selected character
ceiling, `prepare-decision-state-adjudication-batches` greedily packs whole
evidence groups into deterministic bounded prompts. It never splits one
evidence group, duplicates a semantic identity, changes the reconciliation
scope, or adds another judgment pass. Each response remains immutable and
attempt-specific. `combine-decision-state-adjudication-batches` requires one
response per batch, exact batch-local identity coverage, and exact combined
coverage at the unchanged full reconciliation boundary before finalization.
The ceiling is an execution control, not an evidence or semantic rule; one
evidence group that cannot fit fails visibly instead of being clipped.

Saved point briefs and assembled reader outputs enforce the compiler's same
representative-selection rules: at least one unique placement handle, and
coverage of displayed support and counter relations when present. Validation
then recompiles the brief from that selection and requires the saved brief to
equal it field for field, so every other compiler-owned field, including the
reader's non-claim boundaries, is restated by the compiler rather than trusted
from storage. Recomputing brief and axis hashes therefore cannot make an empty,
duplicated, or counter-omitting selection valid, nor can it add, drop, or
rewrite a compiler-owned field. The interpretation and valid representative
choices, including their order, are reused from the saved brief rather than
compared with the original response. This validation correction leaves
reader inputs, schemas, method text, and valid output bytes unchanged.

The current point reader projects the exact meanings named by a displayed row's
`relation_semantic_unit_refs`. A selected row's primary meaning and quote remain
available as lineage, but they are not presented as the relation-owned meaning
when the relation binds only a same-evidence companion. In that companion-only
case the relation-facing quote is explicitly `quote_unavailable` unless a quote
span owned by that exact meaning was captured. This prevents a neighboring
selected-row quote from visually impersonating the meaning that supports,
counters, or sits adjacent to the point; it does not decide whether the chosen
semantic-reference subset is itself warranted.

Current point-reader request v4 also keeps every condition, time, action,
quantity, attribution, and outcome owned by the exact meaning that states it.
A literal quote or companion meaning from the same evidence may provide honest
context, but it cannot lend one observation's fields to a neighboring meaning.
The reader preserves coexisting observations without fusing them or reducing an
experienced outcome to intent alone. The display panel remains selected examples
even when its row count happens to equal the full-pool row count. This is an
existing-reader instruction correction, not a new checker, provider stage,
semantic classifier, or deterministic claim that the interpretation is true.

Current point-reader request v5 additionally keeps current use or possession of
another container distinct from an observed repeat purchase. Only an exact owned
meaning that records acquisition or repurchase can support the completed action.
It also distinguishes the analyst's Phase A boundary from the source's speech:
the reader does not make or infer a Deliver recommendation, but it preserves a
source-authored recommendation as source-local evidence without adopting it.
This changes no evidence relation or state upstream and adds no phrase list,
checker stage, provider call, or deterministic semantic classifier.

Companion-owned semantic fields that the frozen projection does not carry remain
null and are listed in `unbound_meaning_fields`; they never inherit the selected
row's product/version, conditions, axes, polarity, statement, or uncertainty.
When primary and companion meanings are co-bound, the headline meaning is the
owner of the headline quote regardless of reference order. Both the point-reader
compiler and structured-reader validator use the same quote-ownership projection.
The latter accepts honest companion-only quote unavailability and rejects the
neighboring primary quote; this closes an existing consumer gap, not a new
semantic judgment stage.

The confirmation pass still shares the first pass's source role for each row,
because source-role competence is required input for the judgment rather than
leaked first-pass state. Creator-authored rows are constrained to `adjacent` by
deterministic code, so their confirmation carries no independent information;
the confirmation's discriminating power is over the customer truth rows.

Fresh selection manifests use `linked_parent_context_v1`. Exact parent text is
carried only for the point's explicitly admitted semantic refs, not for every
candidate admitted by an axis expansion. The provider-visible projection names
that text once in a compact context table and gives each applicable row its
context IDs; every point-scope confirmation batch receives the same table so
scope is never judged from a context-stripped point. Point-level visibility
does not attach the parent to unrelated evidence: a candidate may use parent
content for its own relation only through its own exact context ID. The full
exact context remains hash-bound in the candidate inventory. A terse agreement
or omitted referent may inherit meaning from that
linked parent only when the parent clearly supplies the same subject,
attribute or outcome, direction, and material condition. Thread proximity by
itself supplies nothing, and a vague phrase stays unresolved when its parent
does not name the missing meaning. Two effects may remain one bounded point
when the source itself presents them as one joined experience under the same
subject, direction, and conditions; this does not permit an actor to assemble
unrelated outcomes across sources. Manifests without the policy retain their
historical no-parent-context reconstruction.

The completed v6 artifact identifies its `point_id` and `bounded_point`, then
discloses candidate semantic-row count, distinct candidate evidence-item count,
candidate truth-origin count, displayed row count, displayed truth-origin
count, display-eligible truth-origin count, relation-specific displayed origin
counts, and displayed creator-influence count. These are evidence-accounting
counts, not customer prevalence. The v6 quote manifest records the truth
selection policy, and the finalizer applies that same policy predicate when it
counts the distinct origins eligible before the cap; the selector and the
reported denominator therefore cannot silently drift apart.
The complete candidate-disposition inventory remains attached, so the display
cannot imply that its selected rows were the whole source pool. The disclosed
candidate truth-origin count is the admitted pool, not the pool the cap chose
from: a truth origin with no operator-protected lane and no material positive
source-native engagement is never display-eligible, and the value-first policy
also excludes an otherwise material adjacent origin. The artifact reports the
exact `display_eligible_truth_origin_count` and its `presentation_basis` names
that pre-cap gate, so the candidate-to-displayed drop is not read as cap
pressure alone. Naming a runtime field `point_id` or `bounded_point` establishes
nothing about boundedness; the separately returned scope classification gates
the completed pack, and the artifact records the passing reason.

Contract v58 makes `phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v8` the normal route for a
new bounded point pack. It retains v7's de-correlated relation check before the
display cap. After the first response accounts for every admitted candidate,
the confirmation workload includes every customer-truth row with material
source-native engagement, every operator-protected row, and every influence
row. This frontier is derived without consulting the first-pass relation. A
first-pass `exclude` therefore cannot make a materially engaged or protected
candidate disappear before its relation is checked.

The confirmation prompt keeps the v6 hidden-label boundary: it exposes the
bounded point and source-owned meaning, conditions, product/version scope,
source role, and companion meanings, but not candidate identity, first-pass
relation or reason, engagement, or selection priority. It returns a relation
and relation-aligned reason code for every opaque row exactly once and also
confirms that the scope is one bounded point. Missing, duplicate, foreign,
reordered, malformed, or broad-scope responses fail closed. A confirmed value
reason must belong to the returned value relation. Unlike v6, a disagreement
does not merely reject a pack after selection: the confirmed relation and
reason replace that row's first-pass values, and the thirteen-origin selection
runs once over the corrected inventory. Every finally displayed row must be in
the confirmation frontier or finalization fails
`selected_relation_unconfirmed`.

V8 quote finalization verifies the hash-bound pre-selection confirmation
lineage embedded in the quote manifest and accepts no separate late
confirmation attachment. Quote extraction remains a separate external
response, so relation adjudication cannot encourage context clipping. V6
remains supported only for exact historical reproduction under its stamped
selected-row confirmation contract. V7 also remains readable and
reconstructible under its stamped 220-character ceiling; neither historical
version is silently upgraded or restamped.

Contract v53 also adds
`phase_a_customer_pull_point_frontier_v1`, a no-provider navigation view over a
complete non-truncated proposition-mode v3 packet. It accounts every selected
proposition matching the requested product subject exactly once and records the
identities and count of propositions excluded by that subject filter. The input,
matched, and filtered counts must reconcile, so subject mismatch cannot masquerade
as complete packet accounting. Retailer-supported customer points enter a
first-look queue because retailer reviews are closest to completed purchase;
community- or qualified-audience-only customer points remain in a separate
discovery queue and record retailer check-back as open. Retailer is not an
admission gate. Creator-authored material cannot supply customer support.
The public packet runner's `--all-propositions` selection derives the complete
proposition-ID set from the finalized view, avoiding an operating-system command
line limit without changing packet semantics; it is mutually exclusive with
axis and explicit proposition selection.
Points earn investigation through explicit reported customer behavior,
independent customer recurrence, material source-native engagement, or an
operator-protected safety/costly lane. Engagement remains comparable only
inside one role, venue, and metric bucket, and no cross-platform commercial-pull
score is created. Materializing one admitted proposition produces a current v2
selection spec bound to the frontier, source packet, bounded point, candidate-
admission mode, transport mode, point subject scope, and literal semantic refs
with the normal thirteen-origin cap. When the exact frontier relations contain
more truth origins, current authoring raises and hash-binds the point-local cap
only to the required count. Above the ordinary configurable ceiling of forty,
preparation and source loading rederive the complete point's exact scope,
relation membership and truth origins from its bound packet; coherent-looking
self-stamped hashes alone cannot authorize a larger cap. Ordinary selections
retain their ceiling. Current point authoring admits only the complete frontier's exact support,
counter, and adjacent refs; it does not reopen a whole product-axis pool for
each point. Historical axis-expanded non-value specs and literal-ref value specs
retain their stamped replay. The
frontier changes no packet, source fact, proposition relation, or Deliver
authority.

When a complete literal-frontier point or historical axis-expanded point exceeds
one response, both relation passes use named batches. The first layer
accounts every admitted candidate. The second independently accounts every
material, protected, or influence row that could reach display, preserving the
v7 pre-cap correction boundary without one hundreds-row response array. Each
layer binds its own manifest, contiguous coverage, response hashes, and required
batch identity; the complete set is deterministically reassembled before the
ordinary v7 selector runs. Missing, foreign, transposed, malformed, or partial
responses fail before quote selection. Historical v6 batching and narrow v7
single-response replay retain their stamped behavior.
The preparation CLI bounds each actual UTF-8 prompt plus compact response schema
at 50,000 bytes by default and separately bounds required row decisions by batch
size. It splits complete contiguous inventories and rejects an indivisible
oversized request before generation, without truncating evidence. Literal-ID
batches preserve candidate IDs and authored reasons through final assembly.
Confirmation replay retains its bound size policy. Complete source-body quote
finalization and downstream readers consume the full validated result; splitting
provider work does not create a smaller evidence denominator. This bounds known
request work, not hidden provider context or a maximum response-token count.

Standing jobs may use the subscription-only bounded recovery entry point in
`forseti-harness/README.md`, over the existing immutable attempt executor.
Recognized capacity/disconnect failures consume finite per-job and shared-run
retry budgets. Inputs and execution policy remain fixed; completed jobs resume
without generation. Unknown execution, authentication failures, input drift and
semantic rejection remain visible failures. A process receipt never substitutes
for native semantic acceptance, and missing usage remains unknown.

Historical axis-expanded non-value specs also bind
`temporal_presentation_policy=recent_year_coverage_v1`. The latest two literal
calendar years in the display-eligible pool receive representation across
available role/venue/native-metric buckets up to half the cap after mandatory
protection and direction reservations; one eligible dated pre-window origin is
retained when space remains. Undated rows remain fully accounted. This is a
presentation preference only: publication time never changes relation,
independence, materiality, or truth weight. Artifacts expose a neutral calendar-
year timeline and never label age strong, weak, fresh, or stale. Native
engagement still orders only within one comparable source bucket.
The timeline is an ordering index, not a freestanding evidence layer: consumers
must dereference each `selected_id` through `source_groups` and preserve its
`layer`; an `influence_context` row never becomes customer chronology merely
because it shares a calendar year with truth-support rows.

Within the retailer-first and community-discovery queues, more independent
supporting origins lead. When origin counts tie, cross-role independent
recurrence leads same-role recurrence, followed by the number of materially
engaged supporting evidence items. Reported behavior is retained as a separate
commercial strength dimension and breaks otherwise equal ties; it is not a
universal source-support rank and cannot make generic trial or ownership
outrank a more strongly corroborated point. This queue-specific order does not
turn the claim-support postures into a universal ranking. Materially engaged
items may share one origin; they add resonance context but do not add
independent recurrence. An unavailable engagement posture earns no
materiality, and engagement magnitude is never compared across venues. An
operator-protected safety or costly-behavior lane keeps a point admitted and
fully accounted, but protection alone grants no ordering priority.

The materialized spec uses `relation_policy=bounded_point`: relation direction
is evaluated against that proposition's exact wording. Thus an expensive-price
complaint supports an expensive-price point instead of being inverted by the
historical positive-good-value box. Existing non-frontier value selections keep
their `auto` value policy for exact reproduction.

A generic batched display label is never semantic authority for quote choice.
For a long source body, the returned exact substring must directly express the
source-owned normalized meaning or a material same-evidence companion
qualification. A relation-derived label alone cannot make an irrelevant
substring acceptable. The exact span must not start with an unresolved pronoun
when nearby preceding text names its antecedent.
Product identity may still rely on the evidence row; this pronoun rule does not
require an otherwise exact, relevant span to repeat it. Quote selection must
prefer a context-complete span over the shortest matching phrase and directly
substantiate every material outcome, direction, comparator, formula
distinction, and usage or timing condition in the normalized meaning. It must
retain a nearby material qualification and cannot stop mid-phrase. It may
return unavailable only after checking that no contiguous exact span supports
the complete normalized meaning; quote length alone is not a reason to reject
available evidence.

Contract v40 clarifies value evidence without changing packet v3 or the
selection schema. Candidate admission for a value axis is direction-neutral:
the consumer admits the relevant positive and negative evidence before an
external response relates each row to the bounded claim. `support` and
`counter` are claim-relative labels, not permanent sentiment or commercial
value labels. A customer may say the price feels high while also showing
willingness to pay through purchase or repurchase. For a bounded poor-value
claim, that behavior is counterevidence and may be described in plain-language
presentation as a positive willingness-to-pay or value signal.

Atomic source meanings remain separately traceable. Presentation may group
same-evidence, same-actor, same-action, same-direction meanings into one
lossless statement — for example, an intention to repurchase Vanilla and
Vanilla Beige — while retaining every underlying semantic-unit reference,
named object, condition, exact quote, and provenance. It must not group across
independent origins, erase a conflicting clause, or turn shade-specific
repurchase into an unqualified general repurchase claim.

Contract v41 versions new quote manifests to
`phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v2`. Each selected row now requires one
concise `presentation_statement` alongside its exact quote. The statement owns
the useful evidence-bound commercial reading, may perform the lossless grouping
allowed above, and keeps material reversals in one sentence. It does not append
generic method caveats whose boundaries are already carried by the source-owned
fields and this contract. Legacy v1 quote manifests retain their prior response
shape and remain finalizable; packet v3 and completed evidence stay unchanged.

Contract v42 replaces that unlanded v2 presentation experiment with
`phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v3`. A selected row carries one short
customer-facing `display_label` plus the exact quote; it does not carry a second
paraphrased sentence. The finalizer derives the label from the already-validated
relation `reason_code`; the quote response returns no label text. The label
names the evidence signal itself — for example,
`Repurchase intent despite price`, `Product appeal outweighs price concern`,
`Explicitly worth the price`, or `Too little product for the price` — and never
exposes the internal support/counter/adjacent/exclude relation. Relation
finalization rejects a missing, malformed, overlong, or relation-leaking reason
code before it can become display text. The
unlanded v2 manifest produced only scratch dogfood and is not a supported
historical runtime contract; legacy v1 remains finalizable byte-for-byte.

Contract v43 makes value-only presentation direct and positive-first without
changing `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3` or adding a score. When the sole selected
axis is `value_and_quantity`, or an explicit-reference-only bounded selection
admits candidates that all carry that axis, the emitted relation-response schema limits
reason codes to a small relation-aligned value vocabulary. Support or counter
requires the candidate's own normalized meaning to state a price, value,
quantity-for-price, purchase commitment, repurchase, or benefit-for-cost
tradeoff. Same-evidence companions may qualify a direct premise — including
purchase or repurchase despite price discomfort — but companion-only formula,
hydration, scent, gift-card, trial, or generic purchase meanings remain
adjacent. A value code may describe the combined visible meaning of a candidate
and its same-evidence companions when one supplies the price/value premise and
another supplies the purchase behavior. When an explicit price premise and
purchase behavior are jointly visible, the customer-facing code carries the
`despite_price` qualifier. Explicit same-evidence regret, waste, or poor value
makes every candidate from that origin counter or adjacent unless the source
explicitly commits to buy or repurchase again despite the cost, or explicitly
concludes that the product is worth the price. Displaying empties, using the
product up, or otherwise trying to make a regretted purchase feel more
worthwhile is sunk-cost rationalization, not countervailing value evidence.
Those two exceptions settle the lane before either regret reason is reached:
neither applies to an origin the source keeps positive by explicitly committing
to buy or repurchase again despite the cost, or by concluding the product is
worth the price. Where the regret does keep the candidate counter, the
counter reason `high_spend_followed_by_buyer_remorse` is available only when
one evidence item explicitly records a substantial completed spend amount, or
explicitly characterizes the completed spend as substantial, together with
cost-linked regret. Multiple units alone do not establish high spend. It adds no generic
customer-journey fields and implies neither repurchase, transaction count, nor
future intent; regret without that explicit substantial completed spending remains
`purchase_regret_due_cost`. The
deterministic finalizer rejects a value reason code placed in the
wrong relation lane. A behavior observed without an explicit price premise uses
a plain purchase, repeated-purchase, or repurchase label; the corresponding
`despite_price` label is valid only when price or cost is explicit. Quantity
efficiency without an explicit price judgment uses `product_goes_a_long_way`
rather than claiming the benefits justify the price. Time to finish, pan, or
empty a product is completed-use evidence, not quantity efficiency, repurchase,
or good value by itself. It remains adjacent unless the same evidence explicitly
states a purchase or repurchase; that explicit behavior receives the matching
behavior code. `product_goes_a_long_way` requires an explicit statement that a
small amount suffices or another direct quantity-efficiency judgment.

After every protected safety or costly-behavior row is admitted, value-only
presentation fills materially positive support origins first. Purchase and
repurchase behavior precede other direct value meanings inside each
source-native venue/role/metric bucket, and buckets continue to round-robin for
source visibility. The primary positive anchor is chosen first by semantic
value-signal priority, then stable source bucket identity; native engagement is
used only within that fixed source-native bucket. At most one ordinary counter
may be shown: the highest native-engagement direct counter from that anchor's
same venue/role/metric bucket. If no support exists, one materially positive
complaint is still shown from the complaint bucket chosen by the same
semantic-first, stable-bucket rule. If the comparable bucket has none, no
ordinary counter is manufactured. An already visible protected counter
suppresses the ordinary counter; at the cap, an ordinary counter may displace
the most recently added ordinary support origin but never the anchor. Protected
rows remain mandatory. This rule never compares raw engagement across platforms
and does not convert engagement into corroborating headcount or a
commercial-pull score. Mandatory protected groups are also ordered without a
cross-venue engagement term. The quote prompt now carries the deterministic display
label and requires a longer-body exact substring to express that label through
the normalized meaning or the same-evidence companion meaning that justified
it, or return unavailable. Semantic fit remains externally
adjudicated; deterministic exactness and body identity checks are unchanged.

Every evidence row carries its source publication time when the preserved
source exposes one. Reddit post/comment timestamps, Sephora submission times,
Amazon source dates, and Revolve creation times enter the semantic source and
flow through packet v3 to the final selection artifact. For a current bundle
carrying a valid materialized-source identity, an absent publication time stays
unavailable and the selection consumer does not reopen Collection artifacts.
A historical bundle without that identity may rehydrate a missing time only
from the exact hash-bound source artifact named by the bundle; missing source
bytes and unsupported legacy source formats remain unavailable, while changed
bytes fail rather than supplying a date. This is source chronology for later time alignment, not proof that search
interest caused the evidence or vice versa.
Source-relative display labels such as `2 months ago` stay preserved in the
hash-bound source but do not become exact publication times. The selection
consumer maps only that narrow relative-label shape to explicit unavailability;
it never derives a calendar date from the execution date, and other malformed
date strings continue to fail closed.
For a multi-product frontier, current point-spec authoring derives and hashes
the subject-product scope of the exact packet proposition. It does not copy the
frontier's company-wide product filter into every point. That identity remains
exact while current selection consumes only the literal point relations;
historical unscoped bindings retain their replay behavior.

Semantic posture distinguishes first-hand experience, personal agreement,
attribution or echo, questions, speculation, observable statements, and actor
strategy. Uncertainty remains a separate dimension. The compiler never turns
an echo, question, creator framing, or unknown actor into an independent
customer experience.

## Prompt-bounded hierarchy

Route 1.6 bounds the actual rendered UTF-8 bytes of every extraction and
reconciliation prompt, including method, schema, axes, context, and formatting
overhead. A single evidence item or semantic candidate that cannot fit fails
before agent output is accepted.

Reconciliation may repeat in levels. A level reads immutable candidates from
the prior level and emits child-referenced semantic nodes. Deterministic code
validates exact child accounting, source/product/comparator/version bindings,
condition lineage, polarity lineage, stale hashes, cycles, duplicate credit,
and flattened leaf provenance. Every stage and node compilation retains the
root batch-compilation hash; finalization rejects a terminal hierarchy whose
root hash differs from the supplied batch compilation even when the visible
leaf denominator happens to match. The agent still owns whether meanings are
equivalent and how conditions, negation, and uncertainty should be described.
Structural completeness is therefore proven; perfect open-world semantic
recall is not.

Current method-v13 reconciliation uses decision-only response v3. The model
authors bounded nodes, relations, axes, uncertainty and terminal metadata. One
required keyed decision per candidate names one or more node attachments or an
allowed unmerged reason, never both. One required keyed assignment per original
emerging label names a declared label group. Missing, foreign, duplicate,
orphan and prohibited decisions fail visibly; the compiler never chooses a
group, inserts a singleton, invents a missing definition or infers prose meaning.
Normal-mode admitted customer findings must remain nodes; they may remain
nonterminal when terminal warrant is uncertain. Convergence retention remains
under the existing source-row rule.

Code carries compatible subject/comparator/version identities (every selected
child must match; unlike identities are never unioned), exact emerging-label
unions and polarity composition. Code also carries every literal child
condition, deduplicating only identical strings. These source-owned fields and
child_relations are absent from the model-authored node shape, not optional
copies whose conflicts can be ignored. The compiler retains each condition's child
lineage; their union does not assert that every condition holds for every
author. At later levels, retain prior-node qualifications as node conditions
without inventing original-leaf ownership for them. Each supporting child must
establish the chosen common claim, not every other child's more specific detail.
Use ordinary context-supported interpretation and informative abstraction under
the owning claim-support rule. A shared brand ID does not make an unnamed item
a range-wide claim; generic approval is not a particular benefit. Intent,
acquisition, use, and repurchase are not interchangeable. Differences in scope,
conditions, intensity or uncertainty require separate nodes when they change
the proposed assertion, not by default. Current response-v3 prompts teach both
valid compression and overstatement limits; historical response-v2 prompt replay
keeps its original wording. No lexical rule or deterministic semantic classifier
is added, and neither the fewest nodes nor the most singletons is a success target.
The prompt also exposes source roles by existing leaf relation, the
compiler-owned terminal claim-kind competence table, and the compiler's
existing rule for composing a leaf relation with the chosen child relation, so
effective support is stated rather than guessed. An observable-statement
posture alone does not make a community report a directly verified fact.
Material with no semantically appropriate, source-competent terminal kind
remains nonterminal or, where retention permits, retrievable as unmerged
evidence rather than being relabeled to pass.
These are derived prompt facts, not new stored authority or relaxed validation.
Method v11 and earlier prompt replay is unchanged. Existing saved prompts and
responses remain historical evidence; a changed current prompt is recorded
as a fresh attempt, never silently substituted into an old receipt.
Explicit response-v2 preparation remains available for replay. A partially
completed immutable stage may receive new v3 requests without repartitioning;
only JSON whitespace may be compacted to retain byte fit. Stored v2 and new v3
responses share the existing validator and downstream node-compilation-v2
shape, without replacing raw provider artifacts. No normal-path semantic provider
stage is added. Mechanical assembly does not prove that chosen meanings belong together.

Normal method-v12/v13 response-v3 preparation now selects
`exact_identity_namespaces_v4` at the public `prepare-reconciliation-level`
entrypoint. The separately selected `authoring_revision` is not a response or
stage schema revision. Each exact tuple of subject, comparator and version
**sets, with their roles preserved**, gets a code-derived opaque prefix. Every
candidate's attachment keys must use that prefix; node definitions may use the
batch's prefixes. Any number of model-authored keys, shared claims and multiple
attachments remain possible within a class. No identity vocabulary is copied
into these handles. Matching prefixes establish compatibility, not semantic
warrant, actual product identity truth, or useful consolidation.

This normal-request-only constraint applies at every reconciliation level and
mode. V2 introduced the existing native repeated-leaf rule before generation:
one original semantic leaf may enter a node through only one attached child.
Fresh V2 stages cap a batch at 96 candidates as well as the existing prompt-byte
limit. The cap bounds output and connected-repair scope; it does not choose a
meaning, truncate context, weaken the native consumer, or promise provider
success. V3 presents exact shared-leaf groups instead of asking the model to
reconstruct them. V4 retains those groups and adds the shared supported-meaning
guidance described below. New stage packing includes the instruction bytes; immutable resumed
stages retain their membership and fail visibly if whitespace compaction cannot
fit the complete prompt. Native identity checks remain unchanged for all
relations. The restriction removes an incidental signal previously carried by
attempted incompatible merges; equal upstream-discrepancy discovery sensitivity
is not claimed. It adds request bytes, not a provider call or a new review stage.

Use `--authoring-revision exact_identity_namespaces_v1`, `exact_identity_namespaces_v2`,
or `exact_identity_namespaces_v3` to reproduce the corresponding prior
namespaced normal requests, or `--authoring-revision legacy` to reproduce the
older unrestricted normal requests.
The low-level Python preparation APIs retain their historical default for replay;
current callers explicitly select `RECONCILIATION_AUTHORING_IDENTITY_V4`.
V4 uses its role-specific shared formation instruction once; v13's explicit
prior authoring revisions retain their original full-method preamble.
Explicit response-v2 and older methods retain historical public defaults.
Missing-definition and local-repair requests use the unchanged historical
renderer/schema and can preserve existing opaque keys. Accepted work keeps its
actual original prompt, schema, attempt and correction receipts; newly rendered
unused requests are never substituted as its provenance. Neither namespace
compliance nor native acceptance proves source-supported meaning preservation.

Current normal authoring and selection consume the same supported-meaning
standard from `judgment/claim_meaning.py`. Claim formation chooses a useful
shared assertion without introducing an analyst's stronger status label or
threshold. Selection interprets the already-bound claim through ordinary
paraphrase and context-supported entailment; it cannot broaden the claim to
admit evidence. A missing required qualifier is insufficient support, not by
itself an opposing report. Source-authored causal attribution may support a
reported-experience claim while the analyst's causal ceiling remains intact.
An evidentiary limit ("does not establish X") is not a source fact asserting
that X did not happen. Evaluate a report at its stated time; later action does
not erase an earlier reported state unless the claim requires its persistence.
Actual identity, condition, time, intensity, uncertainty and action-state
differences remain material. This applies the owning claim-support contract;
it adds no lexical semantic classifier, evidence filter or provider stage.

A row whose own relevant precondition never arose for its speaker does not
report an incompatible outcome. The model distinguishes that absence of an
occasion from actual counterevidence. Ref-selection rules constrain which
stored meanings may be cited, without overriding their context-supported
interpretation or donating another meaning's unstated facts.

Selection manifest v3 binds this guidance in new first-pass and confirmation
requests and in adjudication reuse eligibility. Confirmation first states one meaning criterion in the
existing `point_scope_reason` before applying it across rows, without adding
a field or provider stage. Quote manifests also carry
`claim_meaning_policy: supported_claim_meaning_v1` for the selected-row
confirmation route. Selection v1/v2 and explicit prior reconciliation authoring
revisions keep their original prompts and adjudication basis. New instructions
do not reinterpret frozen responses or establish semantic correctness merely
because a response passes structural validation.

The current development revision updates the v3 policy basis, so prior v3
adjudications under different instruction bytes require a fresh adjudication;
stored prompts and responses remain evidence of their actual attempt. Historical
v1/v2 replay is unchanged. Each confirmation batch states its own criterion.
The combined response retains the first batch's reason, while attempt records
preserve all reasons; there is no cross-batch semantic consistency proof.

Current response-v3 generation requires a nonempty node list when any assigned
candidate must remain a finding under the existing retention rule. This prevents
an empty answer, not partial definition omissions. The native consumer reports
undefined node keys separately as `MissingReconciliationDefinitions`, with their
exact child/relation assignments. Other malformed assignments still fail; the
diagnostic does not certify that an undefined key denotes a legitimate claim.

After this failure only, `prepare-reconciliation-definitions` binds the original
failed response and prepares one corrective judgment request containing only the
affected candidate groups. One required keyed slot supplies either a complete
model-authored definition or an explicit cannot-define reason. Keys are opaque
handles, never evidence of meaning. An unsupported fixed grouping or insufficient
context remains a visible semantic-judgment blocker; code never selects a meaning,
redirects an attachment or changes existing definitions. Large missing sets may
still require substantial provider work; an oversized recovery fails visibly
without truncation. No automatic repartitioning or unbounded retry is introduced.

`submit-reconciliation-definitions` appends only the missing model-authored nodes
to a fresh successor, then applies the unchanged native reconciliation consumer.
An unresolved answer publishes no successor. Original, corrective and successor
bytes and hashes remain separate; the original failed attempt is not relabeled
successful. Matching durable successors can be revalidated without another call;
changed inputs or outputs fail rather than overwrite. The provider execution and
usage-accounting route is unchanged. Use at most one corrective attempt for a
failed batch before returning unresolved work to judgment. Successful batches owe
no corrective call. Historical v2 replay and immutable stage membership stay intact.
Completeness and unchanged assignments are mechanical claims; semantic warrant
and improved provider reliability are not proven by successful composition.

Contract v34 adds an opt-in global relation-closure generation after one
terminal normal-retention frontier. Deterministic block pairs cover every
unordered frontier-candidate pair exactly once; each pair terminates as
`equivalent`, `opposed`, `distinct`, `adjacent`, or `unresolved`. Prompt batch
and local node handles are transport only. Equivalent pairs form transitive
classes, while opposed pairs form symmetric inter-class links. Directional
class identity uses a deterministic truth-complete assertion already present
on a validated frontier node plus product/comparator/version, conditions,
uncertainty, claim kind, and causal ceiling; axes and raw polarity are not hash
salt. `mixed` input polarity fails closed for whole-row repair. A hash-bound
coverage manifest must decide every required pair, with zero unresolved pairs,
before finalization may report `none_observed`; incomplete coverage is not a
negative conflict finding. This generation emits integration view v3 and does
not change policy-v2 artifacts or their finalization behavior.

The v34 generation is experimental, not an operational full-corpus route. A
dated operator observation on 2026-08-13 read the machine-local policy-v2 normal
frontier at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-full-corpus-v8-20260812-v0\reconciliation-policy-v2\level-0002\node_compilation.json`
(raw-file SHA-256
`23b417fde1de678379fabf54ea50fdcaaac7b8e0811b5d21c4227d53c40b7d75`;
stored `node_compilation_sha256`
`344e38ac29c0dbe27af397271ed0657b96b983e87e4b679f318cd8ba5311c473`)
and observed 7,076 semantic nodes plus 780 carried unmerged units. A read-only
name scan of that run root observed no relation-closure output. These are dated
operator observations over that exact path, not a repository-backed universal
absence claim. Exhaustive preparation would require millions of pair decisions;
v34 must not be run on, or used to claim `none_observed` for, that observed
frontier. Only a complete validated closure compilation may carry that posture.
Structural membership, pair-identity, and cardinality checks contain malformed
or internally inconsistent artifacts; without the source stage and raw
responses they do not prove semantic truth or detect a coherently forged whole
artifact.

### Supported operating route and owner-only reopen boundary

#### Experimental reconciliation packing (unpromoted)

The 2026-09-12 narrow continuation adds opt-in authoring
`exact_identity_namespaces_v6`. It inherits v5 and explicitly distinguishes
lack of support from opposition: undecided, unknown, untried or missing
information alone does not establish a contrary claim. Counterevidence must
express a contrary meaning in materially comparable scope; genuine objections
remain counterevidence. A supported undecided state may stand as its own finding
or qualify another as adjacent evidence when warranted. It must not become
invented intent or rejection. A finished finding may preserve source uncertainty
when its meaning and evidence relationships are settled; source uncertainty
alone is not unfinished analysis. Unsupported claims, invented resolutions,
source-role changes and retention relaxation remain forbidden.
V6 changes prompt guidance only. Schemas, validators, completion predicates,
normal/convergence routing and historical authoring bytes remain unchanged.
Use the same explicit revision on resume; default authoring remains v4.
The fresh matched 44-candidate frontier test passed with both v5 and v6:
undecided repurchase stayed separate, unknown agreement target remained explicit
in a terminal finding, and a genuine value objection remained counterevidence.
This is a tie, not evidence of a reliability gain. A fresh v6 45-row run using
all 117 preserved verified statements completed in two normal rounds with three
workers, versus the historical v5 grouping run's five rounds/six workers.
All 65 final meanings and relations passed controller source-backed inspection;
113 statements were represented and four remained explicitly retrievable,
with exact conditions and repeat-identical final output. This is not independent
blinded certification. Estimated worker cost was $1.4446 versus historical
$2.8765688 (49.8% lower; 47.8% with cache reuse normalized), not a fresh paired
full-run comparison. Added instruction bytes changed initial packing from
93/24 to 91/26. Historical v5 prompts replayed byte-for-byte across 13 jobs;
106 affected and 18 contract checks passed. The narrow test passed; default
promotion, 121-row scale qualification and delegated patch review did not occur.

The subsequent matched 121-row qualification on 2026-09-12 stopped in its
first round on a material v6 relation error. Both arms reused the same 323
verified statements and used Sol/high with group-aware packing. V6 attached
two Brown Sugar ownership statements as support to a purchase finding alongside
one explicit purchase; v5 kept those same statements as ownership and purchase
separately. Native batch validation accepted the response, but source-backed
inspection rejected the unsupported purchase support. No full consumer output
or completed-run savings was established. This does not establish that v6
wording caused the error; the existing shared formation rule already forbids
it. V6 remains unpromoted; this failed scale test alone did not qualify delegated patch review. Exact
evidence and stopped-run accounting are in
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-neutral-scale-121-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).

A subsequent owner-authorized Astra/low judgment reused the exact failed
92-candidate v6 prompt, schema and stage bytes. It separated ownership from
purchase, but controller inspection of all 45 returned findings found a smaller
unsupported `owned` qualifier in a general approval finding. Native batch
validation passed; this is a target-case improvement, not a clean full-run or
model-default qualification. Estimated worker cost under the frozen comparison
rates was $0.976506 versus $0.4697448 for the earlier Sol/high judgment.
Evidence: `docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-astra-low-batch-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).
Known errors may use the existing nominated local-repair route described above;
this observation introduces no per-turn reviewer or automatic error detector.

The subsequent one-worker Sol/high local-repair dogfood corrected the original
ownership/purchase group using the existing route: all three sources survived,
89 unrelated decisions and 39 unrelated findings stayed exactly unchanged, and
native durable successor validation plus repeat submission passed. Estimated
worker cost was $0.3219392 versus the earlier full-batch $0.4697448. Two truncated
intake attempts caused rereads and 311,304 total tokens; at equal cache reuse the
estimated saving is only 2.3%. This proves the nominated correction, not lean
dispatch, automatic detection or completion of the stopped run. Future repair
dispatches should reuse the existing complete-intake output pattern rather than
introducing a new semantic stage. Exact successor and limitations:
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-targeted-repair-dogfood-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).

The matched delivery-only continuation reused that exact repair request with
one fresh Sol/high worker and the normal complete-intake pattern. All 63,321
input-content bytes arrived in one read with no truncation. The correction and
unchanged-scope checks passed again. Worker usage fell from 311,304 to 138,951
tokens (55.4% lower), and the frozen-rate estimate fell from $0.3219392 to
$0.1819992 (43.5% lower; 49.8% lower at the old repair's cache rate). This is one
successful matched repair-delivery test, not full-run or automatic-detection
qualification. The workflow's local-repair instructions now name the same
complete-intake pattern. Evidence and corrected successor:
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-repair-intake-fix-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).

The generated repair launch is specified under **Local reconciliation
correction** above, which owns that supported transport; it is not part of this
experimental packing boundary. Its observed evidence is recorded here. No repair
semantic prompt or schema changed. Three fresh Sol/high cases corrected
neutral-as-counter and unsupported ownership in approval, while preserving
correct positive/negative price evidence.
All delivered complete input in one read, with three model responses per case;
unrelated work was unchanged. These are bounded repair successes, not full-run
qualification or automatic error detection. Evidence, costs and the observed
closing-message receipt-path defect:
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-repair-expanded-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).

The subsequent convergence qualification separately exposes opt-in
`exact_identity_namespaces_v5` via `advance --reconciliation-authoring-revision`
and explicit reconciliation prompt preparation. V4 remains the default.
V5 retains v4 formation/identity guidance and adds `CONVERGENCE_SOURCE_ROWS`
only in convergence mode: deterministic, batch-consistent aliases for original
source rows by candidate and leaf relation. Workers union effective supporting
row aliases rather than adding candidate counts. Two claims in one row remain
one row. Aliases grant no semantic equivalence, corroboration or independent
person count; repeated-support validation still traces original leaves.
This table is distinct from semantic-unit overlap restrictions. The rendered
table counts toward the existing byte ceiling. Use a new run root and retain
the authoring revision on resume; prompt immutability rejects a changed revision.
Historical authoring bytes and response schemas remain replayable. This option
is an unpromoted experiment, not worker-model or scale qualification.
The 2026-09-11 Sol/high qualification passed the isolated same-row convergence
case. The fresh 45-row control then reached native completion after six normal
levels. An initial controller assessment rejected its explicitly unresolved
agreement merely because it became terminal; that assessment was corrected.
A finished finding may preserve uncertainty without inventing its resolution.
Inspection of all 36 final meanings against their attached verified statements
found no material unsupported change; all 117 statements and literal conditions
remain accounted for. This is controller assessment, not independent blinded
certification. The accepted matched treatment completed in five normal levels,
using six Sol/high workers versus seven. Fixed-price worker estimates were
$2.8765688 versus $3.2612808: 11.8% lower, below the required 15% saving;
normalizing both arms to the control's cache reuse gives 12.7%. Both native views
retain 113 represented statements plus four unmerged statements and exact
conditions, and repeat finalization reproduces their respective bytes.
Source-backed treatment assessment found a material relation error: undecided
future repurchase following Cherry/Poppy acquisition became counterevidence to
Vanilla/Vanilla Beige repurchase intention, producing a mixed consumer finding.
Uncertainty is not an opposite intention. Across normal rounds the treatment
processed 355 candidate appearances versus 345; the sole unfinished finding
until the last round was the unchanged ambiguous agreement in both arms.
This one comparison does not establish that packing caused earlier completion.
The experiment fails its adoption signals. At that checkpoint the 121-row confirmation and
conditional delegated patch review had not been commissioned. Subsequent scale
and repair experiments and the bounded code review are recorded above; defaults
remain unchanged. Native completion alone does not establish semantic correctness.

The 2026-09-11 owner-commissioned experiment exposes `group_aware_v1` through
`advance --reconciliation-packing`; `input_order` remains the default and
retains historical stage/prompt identities. The experimental stage hash binds
its packing strategy. Resume with a different strategy fails on existing stage
identity instead of replacing accepted work. A new run root is required to
compare conditions.

Preparation orders intact candidates within exact subject-product, comparator
and version-set buckets, preserving unknown scope separately. Each bucket starts
with the largest existing leaf group, then follows deterministic weighted lexical
proximity with weak axis/condition overlap hints. Polarity is not a partition,
so contrary claims can remain nearby. This is a local lexical approximation:
different wording can be near without being identical, but vocabulary-disjoint
paraphrases can be missed. Same-axis membership and existing groups grant no
semantic authority. The ordering uses no model, service or persistent index.

Only batch membership/order changes. Candidate payloads, condition lineage,
opposition, byte/count ceilings, worker transport, validators, retention rules
and native finalization remain unchanged. Earlier groups may be imperfect;
normal workers retain their existing ability to split meanings, and later
reconciliation of summarized nodes is not an automatic repair guarantee.
Runtime preparation has quadratic worst-case local comparison work within a
scope bucket; record it alongside worker cost in experiments. Adoption requires
a matched completed comparison of total worker work and semantic outcomes plus
the required review/adjudication. Unit tests or fewer first-wave batches alone
do not establish improvement. This exception authorizes the commissioned
preparation experiment only; the deferred architecture directions below remain
unpromoted.

#### Supported completion

The supported completed semantic route for normal Forseti intelligence cycles
is full-corpus extraction, mandatory row verification, policy-v2 normal
reconciliation, convergence/retention under that existing policy, and the
supported view/output. One-off and unresolved evidence remains explicit; lack
of v34 closure never becomes `none_observed`. Agents must not run v34, treat it
as completion, or use it to claim global meaning identity, global opposition
coverage, or global negative conflict coverage.

Local `opposition_checked` does not promote proposition `conflict_posture`,
which stays `not_checked` on every policy-v2 route. Previously pinned affected
v3 views containing `none_observed` must be regenerated before reuse; see the
[v38 compatibility correction](forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog).

A valid normal reconciliation level may temporarily produce more nodes than it
received candidates when one candidate carries multiple distinct bounded
meanings. That is zero convergence rather than malformed accounting: the next
level enters the existing convergence/retention mode, which must resolve the
frontier without silently dropping a meaning.

Convergence treats each incoming candidate as one already-bounded meaning and
therefore permits at most one attachment, or one unmerged retrieval reason.
Meaning splits remain available in normal reconciliation; allowing them again
in convergence would make partial retention unrepresentable and prevent an
honest fixed point.

Every retained convergence node needs effective support from at least two
distinct source rows; adjacent evidence and nonterminal status do not satisfy
that floor.

Convergence does not circulate nonterminal placeholders. Every newly authored
convergence node is terminal. A terminal customer finding supported by repeated
source rows remains required; a nonterminal candidate must either support one
terminal bounded node or remain explicitly retrievable as unmerged evidence.
This retirement changes no leaf disposition and does not turn unresolved
material into a claim merely to satisfy the fixed-point rule. Historical
responses remain replayable through the shared validator; the terminal
finalizer still rejects any nonterminal compilation. The compiler, not the
provider, carries each prior node's terminal status into the next stage; current
convergence prompts expose that bit only to apply the retention distinction.
When a complete convergence pass is one-for-one but still contains nonterminal
nodes, its next stage also hash-binds and carries the already terminal nodes
outside the nonterminal nodes' transitive shared-leaf neighborhood unchanged.
It sends the nonterminal nodes and only their leaf-connected terminal neighbors
back for bounded judgment. This installs no new semantic choice and prevents
repeated whole-corpus reads whose only purpose would be to preserve an already
stable, unrelated terminal majority. A convergence fixed point accounts for
each input as exactly one surviving terminal node or one explicit unmerged
candidate; honest retirement therefore does not force another level merely
because the node count fell.

Axis membership remains compiler-owned lineage. Current decision reconciliation
derives node `axis_ids` from the exact union of its attached children, and the
final v3 consumer rederives proposition `axis_ids` from the verified root
semantic leaves. Provider-authored axis strings carry no authority and cannot
move a proposition across axes. This is deterministic provenance preservation,
not semantic axis inference.

If an explicitly unmerged candidate shares a semantic leaf with a surviving
node, the final leaf disposition is `used`; the same leaf cannot also be emitted
as unmerged. Candidate-level retirement still participates in fixed-point
accounting, and the source remains recoverable through the surviving node.

Registry-first global identity, embeddings or top-k retrieval, deterministic
semantic blocking, and exhaustive all-pairs closure are deferred research
directions, not active implementation routes. An owner may explicitly reopen
architecture work only after a measured customer or intelligence outcome is
materially harmed by duplicate meaning identity or missing global opposition.
When that trigger is recorded, reorient first to this section as the semantic
contract authority and then to
`docs/workflows/phase_a_customer_evidence_completion_path_v0.md` for the latest
run history and operating sequence. Until then, preserving the supported route
and its honest residual evidence is the complete action.

The same generation adds selective whole-row repair. It projects only named
evidence rows through the existing complete-row verifier, preserves every
untouched active row exactly, and writes a repair manifest binding the parent
verified compilation, selected IDs, responses, and new active-row hash. The
new compilation hash invalidates every older reconciliation and view. Repair
never edits semantic nodes or a finalized view directly.

When a completed policy-v2 terminal compilation exists and a selective repair
changes only a narrow set of verified rows, `migrate-repaired-terminal` is the
supported incremental successor route. It admits an old terminal node only
after comparing every complete leaf semantic row it uses against the repaired
compilation; any statement, polarity, uncertainty, product/comparator/version,
axis, condition, or evidence-posture change invalidates that node. The current
route can deterministically rederive a node only when the complete-row repair
changed polarity while leaving the truth-complete statement and every other
semantic field unchanged. Changed unmerged rows retain exact membership and
reason but resolve their semantic content from the repaired compilation. That
is preservation, not fresh semantic adjudication: the migration does not claim
that the prior unmerged decision or reason was reconsidered against the repaired
meaning. A consumer that needs current membership or a freshly supported reason
for such a row must use fresh reconciliation.

The migration compiler hash-binds the raw bundle, old verified compilation,
repaired compilation, old terminal compilation, every terminal leaf, every
unmerged unit, the reuse/invalidation census, and any exact-identity coalescing.
Coalescing requires truth/scope/claim metadata to agree, unions emerging labels,
postures, and lineage, rejects relation or condition-lineage conflicts, and
uses logical AND for opposition checking. It is not relation closure and cannot
carry closure-only fields or make a global `none_observed` claim. `finalize-v3`
recomputes claim support, evidence stacks, and reverse indices from the migrated
nodes plus repaired compilation, and retains its independent duplicate-identity
guard. A broader proposition-linked semantic change, any requested membership
change, incomplete leaf proof, or missing source artifact falls back to a fresh
supported reconciliation replay.

For bundle v4, agent-facing reconciliation prompts carry child references and
the meaning dimensions needed to judge a merge, but omit expanded
`leaf_relations` and `condition_lineage`. The stage and compiler retain that
full lineage and deterministically reconstruct it from accepted child
references. The terminal hierarchy must still fit one declared prompt-bounded
batch; v7 neither raises that ceiling nor claims that an unexecuted full corpus
will converge to it.

Emerging labels are consolidated semantically before seal. The agent groups
meaning-equivalent labels; the compiler preserves every original label and
never invents a merge. Each consolidated candidate terminates as `accepted`,
`nonmaterial`, or `blocker`. Every parent node preserves the exact union of its
children's emerging labels. Under bundle v4, exactly one prompt batch owns the
level-wide emerging-label decision and receives the complete unique label set;
every other batch must return no consolidations. This prevents parallel prompt
batches from making overlapping or conflicting decisions about the same label
without replacing that semantic decision with a deterministic compiler choice.
Once validated, a consolidation is carried
unchanged through every later level; no later response may duplicate,
overwrite, drop, or invent its original-label disposition. A lower-level
`blocker` therefore remains visible in the terminal view and blocks seal.

## No-provider workflow

The runner makes no model API call. Historical v1/v2 routes retain their four
operations. Before current-route batching, a reusable full-corpus run uses an
immutable `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v1` specification. The spec binds
the final acquisition seal, cycle/question/cutoff, current axes, rendered
prompt ceiling, external run root, and hash-pinned v3 source fragments. Every
sealed route must terminate as exactly one of `semantic_source`,
`structured_reference`, `discovery_only`, `control_only`, `duplicate_of`, or
`blocked`. Only `semantic_source` routes carry v3 source bindings and owe
exhaustive leaf-level semantic processing. In Phase A those routes are the
Reddit/community conversation corpus and retailer review text. Ads, owned
pages, PDP facts, creator posts, editorial, and other captured materials stay
hash-verified `structured_reference` routes: they remain usable evidence but
do not owe customer-language corpus conversion. A duplicate route must name a
`semantic_source`, `structured_reference`, or blocked owner and may not form a
duplicate chain. `blocked` is reserved for a required semantic source that is
still missing and prevents materialization.

The customer-corpus census rereads packet-backed Reddit records and verifies
retailer source-row references before semantic work. A
`retailer_review_source_manifest_v1` pins every retailer source file by raw-byte
SHA-256, names its admitted parser family, and binds the source-native review-ID
set. Current packet replay accepts both old-Reddit and preserved www-Reddit
HTML through their existing source-owned parsers. A conversation container
reports the source-visible total and completeness posture its own projection
states: old-Reddit markup declares no thread comment total and stays
`unavailable`, while a www projection supplies the source-declared total, and a
measured shortfall or a deliberately unfollowed continuation link makes that
container `partial` with the shortfall named in its capture boundary. An exact
match between the declared and captured counts is never promoted to `complete`,
because the source-declared total is not an independent completeness oracle.
Current retailer replay also
accepts the Soko Glam/Okendo corpus shape, deriving each stable review identity
from its source-native product slug and positive ordinal. A review-ID substring
elsewhere in a file is never membership proof. Its captured-conversation
union is reconciled against both owning sources: every coded thread family
member must appear in the union, and every reconciled target that already
yielded captured material must keep its native packet binding. It counts roots,
replies, readable leaves, mechanical exclusions, former captured-excluded
leaves, and retailer text/rating-only rows separately. The census is a
denominator proof, not semantic judgment and not a substitute for v3 source
materialization. Large source, prompt, response, and compilation artifacts
remain under the spec's external run root; a compact repository receipt may
bind their hashes.

Normal Evidence Consolidation uses `advance --source <materialized-source.json>
--run-dir <run-root>` in `run_semantic_evidence_integration.py`. Use that same
invocation, including its packing options, for initial preparation and every
resume. It composes operations 7–14 below: extraction compilation, independent
whole-row verification, policy-v2 reconciliation levels and convergence/retention,
then the native final view. Each invocation carries all deterministically ready
steps to the complete next judgment request set, an actionable blocker, or the
current-corpus final view. A command returning is not itself a reason for a new
controller turn. The lower-level commands remain available for historical replay
and explicitly scoped recovery; they are not the normal controller sequence.

The public `advance` return uses compact JSON serialization, preserving every
field and the complete generated worker prompts. Consumers parse once and avoid
pretty-printing the return into coordinator history. Source-dependent judgment
still requires the complete relevant source/claim artifacts; compact control
state never substitutes for them. No new run artifact or state store is added.

The run root contains `bundle.json`, `extraction/`, `verification/`,
`reconciliation/level-NNNN/`, and `view.json`. Each stage uses its existing
prompt, schema, response, stage and compilation artifacts. The returned requests
bind their exact prompt/schema bytes, input identity and response destination;
the returned `judgment_requests`, transitions and artifact hashes identify ready
and persisted work. `artifacts` identifies the current outputs; `transitions`
binds every visited stage/compilation path and its raw-byte hash, including prior
levels. Consumers resolve accepted outputs through those returned paths and
their native lineage bindings, never by globbing the run root; unrelated paths
outside the walked lineage are not inspected or granted authority.
Resume
revalidates the materialized source and accepted lineage, preserves matching
stored outputs, and prepares only missing deterministic artifacts. Different
source, packing, method or prompt identities cannot replace existing work.
Invalid, missing and staged work remain distinguishable. A response that a
stage's accepted compilation already binds stays accepted work: if it later
goes missing or invalid, the run blocks on restoring that artifact instead of
re-requesting a judgment the run has already closed. A blocker exits nonzero;
a judgment-required return supplies every currently ready request and never
credits a missing answer. No semantic retry, response selection, identity reset,
new acquisition, synthesis authorization, or global relation-closure claim is
implied. Finalization still applies its native terminal and completeness gates.

Each ready request also binds a `semantic_judgment_job_v1` descriptor by raw
SHA-256. Only dispatchable requests receive a descriptor, named by that hash, so
accepted phases resume from any checkout and changed guidance issues a new
descriptor. An older descriptor remains usable only while all of its pinned
inputs remain unchanged; issuing a newer descriptor does not revoke it.
`intake-judgment-job --job <job_path> --job-sha256 <job_sha256>` verifies
the descriptor and every input, then returns the entire prompt, schema and
necessary role guidance with byte counts and a final `intake_end` marker. A
controller forwards the generated `worker_prompt`, which binds both nested
tool output budgets and emits all content as separate bounded `notify` outputs
within one tool invocation, with contiguous offsets and no model turn between
pieces. Accumulated `text` items can share an aggregate truncation limit;
separate outputs preserve complete delivery without clipping evidence.
The worker checks truncation
warnings and metadata at both layers; a marker alone can survive middle
truncation and does not establish complete intake. Before emitting content, the
generated delivery compares each parsed section's UTF-8 bytes with the intake
counts and stops with `INCOMPLETE_INTAKE` on any difference. A
truncated tool return is incomplete intake; the worker must retrieve the whole
input before judging. `submit-judgment-job` with the same binding and
`--response <raw-answer.json>` preserves exact raw bytes, checks the assigned
batch identity, applies the native phase validator and atomically publishes
without replacement. Its compact durable receipt identifies the job, accepted
response hash and validated batch. Identical accepted bytes may be revalidated
to recover a missing receipt; different bytes never replace accepted work.
Invalid raw answers remain visible at the normal staged-response boundary.
Publication or cleanup failure remains a blocker, including a crash after the
final link was created. These operations do not change accepted response
versions, semantic validation, reconciliation meaning or termination policy.

Desktop transport boundary: accumulated `text` output can omit items and
truncate a block despite larger requested allowances. Native logs can preserve
complete bytes while the model-visible return is incomplete. Use the separate
`notify` outputs in the generated dispatch, and check their contiguous coverage
and end markers. Stop before judgment when the complete input cannot be made
visible; a successful CLI return or intact native log does not clear this
consumer boundary. A changed transport still requires observed complete delivery.

If verification leaves no active claim-bearing rows, `advance` returns the
actionable `NO_CLAIM_BEARING_EVIDENCE` blocker before creating reconciliation
levels. Inspect the verified dispositions and obtain an explicit disposition
under existing owner authority; unchanged reruns cannot resolve it. This exposes
the supported route's existing limitation; it does not authorize an empty view,
new judgment, or acquisition. A crash-left deterministic `.tmp` is also blocked,
with the exact recovery instruction: preserve and move that unaccepted staging
file outside its output directory, then rerun to validate existing outputs and
rebuild missing artifacts. Accepted outputs must not be overwritten or removed.
Staged semantic responses retain their separate explicit-recovery boundary.

Current-route operations are (the individually callable seams):

1. `audit-phase-a-source` verifies the final seal, every terminal route
   artifact, every route classification, and every hash-pinned source binding.
2. `build-retailer-source-manifest` pins the current retailer source files and
   structurally proves their review identities. For a retrospective run this
   proves the bytes available now; it does not rewrite or restamp the historical
   acquisition seal.
   `build-phase-a-reddit-source-v3` then materializes every packet-backed root
   and comment, and `build-phase-a-retailer-source-v3` materializes every
   source-native retailer review. Both commands preserve the captured
   denominator, mechanically exclude only exact non-text placeholders, and
   keep repository-owned locators relative to the declared repository root.
   The retailer builder verifies a Revolve completion receipt whenever the
   source manifest contains Revolve, and requires no unrelated Revolve receipt
   for a non-Revolve corpus. It retains every
   captured source file, and de-duplicates a repeated native review identity to
   one customer evidence item while preserving every source-pinned product
   listing context carried by its occurrences. A repeated listing occurrence
   does not become another customer experience. A source-native review with no
   usable text remains a mechanical exclusion and must still appear in the
   captured denominator; readable uncoded rows still fail closed. No admitted retailer source
   format preserves a capture timestamp, so retailer capture envelopes record
   capture time as unavailable rather than stamping a run-derived date.
3. `build-serp-source-surface-spec` reads hash-pinned Phase 1 and Phase 2
   queue-state receipts selected by their terminal returns, derives every
   successful job-to-packet edge, and requires the
   bounded surface map to match that producer-owned inventory exactly;
   `prepare-serp-source-frontier` enumerates every source-bearing row; and
   `materialize-serp-source-frontier-review` accepts one explicit agent-authored
   decision for every inventory row (no bulk/default decision), mechanically
   deduplicates repeated locators, and emits recovery targets that target
   reconciliation must settle. An exclusion reason explains why this row cannot
   change the commissioned decision or a named axis. Missing URLs, snippet-only
   status and non-promotion are acquisition/claim limitations, not exclusion
   grounds; material unresolved leads remain routed. The materializer verifies
   the inventory's own content hash, so a hand-edited row set cannot be reviewed
   under a stale digest. No mechanical check separates a genuine row-by-row
   exclusion from a bulk-filled one, and none is added: a required field is
   filled by the same loop that fills a required reason. That reading is owned
   by this operation's no-bulk/default rule and tested by the final semantic
   source review. `reconcile-serp-frontier-targets` then binds
   exact Reddit and native-social object identities already present in the
   evidence ledger and leaves unmatched historical links explicitly
   unavailable; it performs no fresh acquisition.
4. `census-phase-a-corpus` independently proves the captured Reddit and
   retailer customer-corpus denominators where those Phase A source shapes are
   present.
5. `materialize-phase-a-v3` merges audited, source-family-produced v3
   fragments through the existing v3 materializer and emits Collection's final
   output: one hash-bound `semantic_evidence_source_v3` plus one matching
   `phase_a_semantic_materialization_receipt_v1`. It never guesses a new
   source-family adapter.
6. The lower-level Collection command `materialize-v3` retains source-artifact
   locator/hash verification and normalizes declared containers/leaves into one
   hash-bound v3 source; unsupported families or denominator mismatches fail
   closed. Materialization never renders provisional prompts; prompt packing
   belongs only to `prepare-batches`.
7. `prepare-batches` verifies a materialized v3 source against its stored
   `source_sha256` without reopening Collection locators, then builds the
   method-bound bundle, proves the work-unit bijection, and writes byte-bounded
   prompts. Legacy inputs without a stored source hash retain source-artifact
   locator verification. Current run v9 also
   writes one exact keyed provider-response schema per work unit. Historical v4
   bundles retain their deterministic three-worker assignment manifest; current
   v5 bundles encode no static worker topology.
8. `validate-batch-response` validates one returned batch immediately without
   compiling a partial corpus. `status` reports valid, missing, duplicate, and
   invalid responses so an interrupted run can resume honestly.
9. `submit-batches` validates all agent responses and exact alias coverage.
10. For method v7 and later, `prepare-row-verification` renders byte-bounded independent
    checks for every primary claim-bearing row, and
    `submit-row-verification` requires exactly one `accept`, complete-row
    `replace`, or `unresolved` decision per row before writing the sole active
    compilation. Non-claim rows are not reread.
11. `prepare-reconciliation-level` renders one or more byte-bounded prompts
    from batch units or prior semantic nodes.
12. `validate-reconciliation-response` validates one returned hierarchy batch
    before the level is complete.
13. `submit-reconciliation-level` validates exact child accounting and writes
     the next node compilation; repeat until one terminal level remains.
14. `finalize-v3` flattens terminal nodes back to exact leaves and writes view
     v2.
15. After selective row repair, `migrate-repaired-terminal` may replace a full
    reconciliation replay only when a completed old terminal compilation and
    complete old/new verified compilations establish the leaf-complete equality
    and narrow deterministic-rederivation proof above. It writes a new terminal
    compilation and migration manifest and makes zero provider calls.
16. The historical v34 route, unsupported for normal runs under the owner-only
    reopen boundary above, ran `prepare-relation-closure` over the
    terminal normal-retention frontier, validates each large-run response with
    `validate-relation-closure-response`, runs `submit-relation-closure` only
    after exact global pair-relation coverage, and uses
    `finalize-relation-closed` to write view v3. `prepare-row-repair` /
    `submit-row-repair` may correct named source rows first; any repair restarts
    reconciliation from its new verified compilation hash.
17. `prepare-calibration` reads a hash-pinned source and blind
    owner gold, projects exact bounded slices, and writes route-native sources,
    bundles, fingerprints, and prompts. The calibration spec deliberately
    selects the method being tested and may retarget the same pinned evidence
    from the source's method marker; the route fingerprint binds the selected
    method and exact method hash, so this is explicit method comparison rather
    than fallback. It makes no model call and cannot authorize a corpus run.
    Supported targets are historical methods v5/v6 and the production-owned
    `SEMANTIC_METHODS_V7_PLUS` set (currently v7-v13). Every target in that set
    requires a provenance-bound row-verified compilation for both primary and
    configured cold-repeat evaluation. A new keyed response transport does not
    waive verification; historical v5/v6 replay behavior remains unchanged.
18. `evaluate-calibration` runs the existing response validator, then evaluates
    disposition, unit-count, product/axis/posture, atomic-meaning, cross-source,
    anomaly, and selective cold-repeat obligations. Semantic atom, relation,
    anomaly, and repeat judgments must be explicit and hash-bound to the exact
    compiled responses they judge. Cross-source relation judgments additionally
    bind a final reconciliation view that the evaluator rebuilds from the
    supplied terminal node compilation; extraction output alone cannot satisfy
    a merge or counterevidence obligation. Missing or stale adjudication blocks;
    a critical mismatch fails. The report is a bounded calibration result only,
    never a prevalence estimate, readiness claim, or corpus-resume authority.

Adjudication v3 closes both the unsupported-axis gap and the unmerged-unit
direction gap without a phrase or field-value blacklist. For every semantic
unit in every gold case, the adjudicator must partition the unit's exact
assigned axes into supported and unsupported lists and judge whether its
statement plus polarity preserve what the source actually asserted. Missing
units, axes, direction judgments, extra keys, overlap, or malformed judgments
block; an explicitly unsupported axis or false direction judgment fails the
case. Calibration specs v2 and v3 bind adjudication v3 and cannot pass with v1
or v2 adjudication. Spec v3 adds the closed density audit below; historical
spec v2 remains readable without acquiring that later obligation.
The older versions remain readable with historical specs only; v2 proves its
per-axis obligation but not the v16 per-unit direction obligation.

The calibration spec is authored from source text, required context, and the
run-local catalog before the evaluated responses are read. Fields representing
observed or predicted machine output are forbidden in that gold artifact. Every
gold container — spec, slice, case, atom, relation obligation, repeat bound, and
anomaly threshold — is a closed key set, and the gold must declare at least one
case: an unrecognized or misspelled obligation field is rejected rather than
ignored, so an obligation cannot silently disappear from the gate while the
report still reads as a pass. A `route_contract` pins the method hash,
bundle/response/prompt generations, rendered axes hash, and run-local catalog
hash; preparation fails if the actual route differs on any of those. The same
`route_contract` also records the semantic runner revision and contract version,
but those two are operator-declared provenance only: no observable in-process
value is supplied by the current execution interface to check them against, so
they are carried into the route fingerprint unverified and must not be read as
machine-enforced pins. A
calibration slice may be compact or production-shaped, but every selected
evidence ID must project exactly once, and a claim-bearing gold case must name
at least one required atomic meaning. Evaluation requires the hash-pinned full
source and deterministically rebuilds the expected bounded sources, bundles,
prompts, route fingerprints, and preparation receipt. The supplied preparation
must match those rebuilt artifacts exactly; its self-hash proves internal
consistency only and is not accepted as provenance. Clearly empty reactions
remain accounted as `context_only` with zero semantic units; no phrase blacklist
or deterministic meaning matcher substitutes for the one context-aware
relevance judgment.
Repeated large axis signatures are a deterministic warning, not an automatic
semantic verdict, and must receive a compilation-bound adjudication before a
pass is possible. Selective second reads repack only the predeclared cases into
one separately hash-bound route-native slice; their consistency judgment binds
both the primary compilation for each case and the compact repeat compilation.
Consistency is semantic rather than count-identical: different supported
atomic decompositions may be consistent, but a dropped, added, reattributed, or
directionally changed supported meaning is inconsistent. Judge every unit's
attribution separately, because one reply may contain attributed parent claims
alongside its own first-hand shopping reaction. Axis and attribution judgments
apply to primary cases as well as cold repeats.

Spec v3 may additionally require a `semantic_unit_density_audit` on a slice.
The evaluator deterministically ranks non-gold evidence rows that emitted at
least one semantic unit by descending unit count, breaks ties by evidence ID,
and selects the declared number of rows. Every selected row receives its own
compilation-bound adjudication. The adjudicator checks whether the row's units
are source-supported, independently meaningful, non-duplicative, and no more
finely split than the source warrants. All four checks are explicit and closed:
all true derives `reviewed_benign`, any false derives `reviewed_defect`, and any
unknown derives `unresolved`; a stated outcome that disagrees with those checks
is invalid. A confirmed defect fails; missing, stale, invalid, or unresolved
judgment blocks. This is an anomaly audit, not a new gold case, a prevalence
sample, a deterministic semantic verdict, or a license to relax the
pre-authored cases after seeing output.

The controller is the active agent task. It calls `advance`, dispatches compatible
ready requests to at most three no-API semantic subagents concurrently, each
with a fresh context for exactly one independent request, and advances
again when results arrive. Extraction and its independent verification remain
separate judgments; reconciliation levels respect their input dependencies.
Previous jobs' conversations are not current-job input. Current evidence,
prompt, schema and role guidance supply the sufficient context. Workers use
the complete intake and deterministic submit operations above; code owns
mechanical validation and publication, not worker-authored validation scripts.
Additional reasoning remains allowed when new evidence genuinely requires it;
there is no fixed reasoning-turn quota or evidence clipping.
It treats accepted response artifacts as the durable resume surface. It does not
narrate or return for each deterministic preparation, submit, or check operation.
Repository code prepares, validates, and reports work;
it does not invoke a model through an API or headless CLI. A worker writes a
complete raw response and submits it through the job operation.
The lower-level `publish-batch-response` recovery seam accepts only a validated
sibling `.json.tmp`, atomically creates a no-replace final hard link, and then
removes the temporary name. An existing final response and a filesystem that
cannot provide the no-replace link both fail closed. Missing batches may be
reassigned when no accepted output exists. No
lease, daemon, mutable queue service, or claim-marker subsystem is required.
The returned JSON is untrusted until the corresponding validator accepts it.
Status is derived from validated response files and reports the complete ready
remainder globally for current bundles; historical v4 retains its static
partitions. A dead worker never becomes a completed batch.

If exact prompt packing exposes more work than the available no-API judgment
lane can execute as one bounded run, the status remains
`SEMANTIC_BATCH_JUDGMENT_REQUIRED`. The controller records that observed
capacity boundary; it may not substitute a sample, silently raise the prompt
ceiling, or describe prompt generation as completed semantic integration.

## Failure and seal posture

A passing route-1.5.0 acquisition seal requires:

- a material, terminal `semantic_evidence_integration` route job;
- a completed integration block and resolvable hash-pinned view;
- exact bundle/corpus/method/view hashes;
- `semantic_evidence_integration_method_v2` for a newly sealed route;
- equal admitted and accounted counts with `complete: true`;
- no unresolved material evidence;
- every proposition reference resolved on the axis that cites it;
- every material comparator carries distinct stable subject and competitor
  product IDs, and every cited competitive-choice proposition binds exactly
  those two IDs in that orientation;
- every emerging axis terminally dispositioned; and
- no impossible source-role, independence, repetition, cross-venue, conflict,
  or causal combination.

A passing route-1.6.0 seal additionally requires:

- source v3, bundle v4, method v3, batch-response v2, reconciliation-response
  v2, and integration-view v2 lineage;
- the `phase_a_final_acquisition` corpus profile rather than a bounded
  regression slice;
- captured count equal to assessed plus mechanically excluded plus blocked,
  with every count exact and no blocked item;
- exact container accounting and disclosed capture envelopes;
- a prompt-bounded, acyclic reconciliation hierarchy whose terminal nodes
  flatten to exact leaf evidence and retain the exact root batch-compilation
  lineage;
- truthful evidence-stack counts that keep evidence items, containers,
  independent origins, roles, engagement, support, opposition, and mixed
  containers separate; and
- every emerging-axis candidate consolidated with immutable original-label
  lineage and terminal disposition, including lower-level blockers.

A passing route-1.7.0 seal additionally requires one embedded
`phase_a_serp_source_frontier_v1` in the evidence-depth ledger. Its Phase 1 and
Phase 2 job sets and packet sets must exactly match the successful attempts in
the terminal-return-selected, hash-pinned queue-state receipts. A recovery job
may name its sealed parent through one explicit one-to-one alias. Every
focused-search job must match its own recorded packet set exactly, and every
source-bearing result row from those bounded surfaces must receive exactly one
agent-semantic disposition: `routed`, `duplicate`, or `excluded`; a bulk/default
routing decision is invalid. One resolved packet file has one artifact identity
across all Phase 1, Phase 2, and focused-search surfaces. The same identity may
visibly serve more than one job, but a second identity over the same file would
enumerate its rows twice and is invalid. A
routed row points to an existing native-capture or locator-recovery target with
the exact source URL (or its deterministic recovery locator) and a discovery
job recorded by that row's packet; a duplicate points directly to a routed owner; an
excluded row carries a reason. People-also-ask and related-search prompts are
Google navigation aids, not external sources. This closes the SERP-to-native
linking gap without crawling result pagination or treating SERP text as native
evidence. Blocked and failed attempts remain visible in the producer receipt
but do not become source-bearing packet surfaces. The frontier classifies the
producer-owned set; it never defines that set.

Uncertainty is preserved rather than repaired. Nonmaterial unresolved evidence
may remain visible; material unresolved evidence blocks the affected claim or
the seal. A changed corpus always requires a new view.

## Historical boundary

This contract enters the Understanding Acquire & Seal route at `1.4.0`.
Historical `1.3.0` and earlier seals retain exactly their stamped obligations
and are never rewritten or restamped to claim semantic-integration coverage.
The context-aware method and stable comparator product-ID requirements enter at
`1.5.0`; a historical `1.4.0` seal retains its original v1 method obligation
and never owes the 1.5.0 additions.

Full captured-corpus accounting, prompt-bounded hierarchy, semantic posture,
container/capture-envelope accounting, explicit emerging-axis consolidation,
and truthful evidence-stack counts enter at `1.6.0`. Historical `1.5.0` and
earlier seals retain their stamped view and method obligations and never owe
Route 1.6 fields.

The semantic-source boundary and complete bounded SERP-row linking enter at
`1.7.0`. Historical `1.6.0` and earlier seals are immutable and never owe the
new frontier.

Route `1.7.1` adds packet-bound execution time for credited continuations and
binds the existing consumer-brand semantic review to the exact final ledger,
view and corpus. The CSB Prompt Structure Rules own those acceptance fields and
review mechanics. It adds no row-level exclusion field and no coverage list:
neither would separate a read row from a bulk-filled one, and both would charge
every future collection for a restatement of generated output. This does not
change the Collection to Evidence Consolidation boundary or force structured
references into the customer-language corpus. Earlier stamped routes retain
their original requirements under the explicit historical-audit route; `1.7.1`
and every later route owe these obligations.
