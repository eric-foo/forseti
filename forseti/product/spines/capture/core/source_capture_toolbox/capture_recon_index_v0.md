artifact_role: Capture recon consolidation index (non-authorizing)
scope: >
  Consolidates the scattered per-source capture RECON / INVESTIGATION findings across
  the toolbox, data-capture-spine pressure tests, research receipts, and worktree-resident
  lane findings into one index. Records, per source probed, what was found capturable, at
  which runner rung, where the signal actually lives, and any corrected false-diagnosis.
  This index is the evidence base the capture-investigation doctrine + runbook distil from.
use_when:
  - Drafting the source-agnostic capture-investigation doctrine and per-archetype recipe cards.
  - Checking whether a source archetype already has a worked recon before re-probing it.
  - Locating the highest-signal real probe receipts (captured bytes / live-verified verdicts).
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
open_next:
  - forseti/product/spines/capture/core/operating_model/data_capture_harness_operating_model_architecture_v2.md
stale_if:
  - A new source recon lands (this index is append-only until the doctrine supersedes it as the home).
  - The worktree-resident findings (Sephora/Bazaarvoice reviews; Ulta Apollo embedded-JSON) merge to main.
  - The capture-investigation doctrine is authored and adopts the cross-cutting patterns below as its spine.
```

# Capture Recon Consolidation Index (v0)

## What this is — and is not

This is a **non-authorizing index** of the capture RECON / INVESTIGATION findings already
in the repo — the docs that probed a real source to learn **whether and how it can be
captured**. It exists so the capture-investigation doctrine and its per-archetype recipe
cards are **distilled from real probe evidence, not invented**.

It is **not** a build spec, not validation, not an acceptance claim, and not legal advice.
Verdicts below are **as reported by each source doc**, not re-observed here. It governs
nothing; it feeds the doctrine.

## Cross-cutting patterns — the doctrine seed (highest-value section)

These six patterns recur across independent probes. They are the spine the investigation
doctrine should encode.

1. **"Blocked" is a hypothesis, not a verdict — and it is the dominant false-diagnosis.**
   A 403 / empty body / "anti-bot gated" read was *wrong or imprecise* in multiple
   independent cases: Daimler PDFs (direct-HTTP 403 **and** headless 403, yet **visible
   Chrome + the PDF-viewer download button succeeded**); Sephora reviews (worktree:
   "anti-bot gated" → actually a **scroll-overshoot** that never fired the lazy-load
   observer); Teal/WSO (403 first recorded as "content unavailable," later re-diagnosed as
   an anti-bot gate). **Escalate the interaction (real browser context → user-initiated
   action → progressive scroll → proxy/geo) and re-probe before recording NO-GO.** A false
   "blocked" abandons a capturable source.
2. **Locate the signal substrate first; pick the tool second.** Reddit = raw JSON;
   reviews = a first-party-rendered vendor API (Bazaarvoice); SPA state =
   `__APOLLO_STATE__` / `__NEXT_DATA__` (Ulta, worktree); PDF body = a download button.
   The cheapest working rung is a function of **where the signal lives**, so step 1 of
   diagnosis is finding the substrate, not choosing a runner.
3. **Verbatim-vs-paraphrase is a separate axis from reachable-vs-blocked.** WebFetch
   *reaches* M&I/BIWS but returns **paraphrase**, losing layout/packaging fidelity. A
   recipe must record whether a rung preserves source **bytes**, independent of whether it
   gets through.
4. **The entitlement/legal gate is orthogonal to the technical gate and comes first.**
   LinkedIn policy forbids automated capture **regardless** of technical reachability;
   Reddit's API has a commercial-use gate. A NO-GO can be *legal*, not technical. Never
   bypass an unentitled gate even when it is technically trivial.
5. **NO-GO and PARTIAL are first-class, honest outcomes.** Daimler pre-cutoff archive
   returned **no memento exists** → an honest NO-GO; archive *availability* ≠ body
   *retrieval* → PARTIAL. Concluding "not cleanly capturable within boundary" is a
   *successful* diagnosis, not a failure.
6. **The runner ladder is empirically real and cheapest-first.** archive.org →
   direct-HTTP → **(visible) browser** → cloakbrowser+proxy. "Visible browser + a
   user-initiated action" is a genuine escalation rung that defeats headless-detection
   where both direct-HTTP and headless fail (Daimler).

**Reddit thread discovery (screening seam) — working read shape.** *[discovery-spine cross-lane commission, 2026-06-11]*
- **Substrate (pattern 2):** Reddit's *own* search/listing is the discovery surface; the external search-engine index is the wrong surface — the discovery walk's zero-result on `site:reddit.com` queries is expected, **not** a capture gap. Native surfaces: `old.reddit.com/r/<sub>/search?q=…&restrict_sr=on` (+ `&sort=`/`&t=` window), subreddit listings `/new`, `/top?t=`, and their `.json` variants.
- **Rung (pattern 6, cheapest-first):** **direct-HTTP** is already GO on old.reddit *listing* (prior live run: HTTP 200 → 10 candidate thread URLs) and *thread body* (ECR-consumption probe: HTTP 200 ~104 KB). Parse with the documented `search-title`/`title`→`/comments/` anchors, then run the empty-result surface-shape check before any NO-GO (pattern 1: "blocked" is a hypothesis).
- **Entitlement (pattern 4, gate first):** logged-out public old.reddit page reads sit under the owner-authorized public-content posture; the licensed Reddit **Data API** (commercial-use gate) is a *separate* route not needed for discovery. The existing intake doc's "do not call `.json`" hard stop is that lane's *no-live-mode* discipline, **not** a global entitlement bar — but unauthenticated `.json` is rate-limited / ToS-bounded, so treat it as a direct-HTTP-rung route at human rate with backoff.
- **Residual closed / remaining note:** the search surface live receipt was closed 2026-06-21 by the bounded screening-read service (`old.reddit.com/r/beauty/search?q=skincare+moisturizer&restrict_sr=on&sort=new`: HTTP 200, 112317 bytes, 75 `/comments/` markers, no packet/ECR). The `.json` rate ceiling remains a human-rate/backoff note, not a blocker for old Reddit HTML screening reads.
- **Consumer:** the beauty card-set cards 4-6 access caveat. **Update 2026-06-21:** WebFetch-based walkers still cannot fetch `reddit.com` directly, but the orchestrator can invoke `source_capture.screening_read.screening_read(...)` for bounded public Reddit screening reads. Walkers record the need; they do not call the service directly. For public challenge-walled pages, `source_capture.screening_browser_read.screening_browser_read(...)` returns visible text and classifies `block_shell` on visible text, not full DOM.

A typed final `amazon.sg` redirect authorizes one owner-bounded Surfshark US / New York retry with the same subject and admission checks. Instrumented re-probe showed Amazon's location anchor hydrating about 3.6 seconds after `DOMContentLoaded`, beyond the former 2.5-second cap; one combined-selector visibility wait plus bounded click now stays inside the shared setup window. | `GO_CONDITIONAL_RECOVERY_WITH_AMAZON_OWNED_CONFIRMATION`; patched MakeWaves retry preserved Amazon.com, exact delivery ZIP `10001`, US marketplace markers, bound subject, no access block, and `pin_confirmed=true`. Earlier failed retry `01KXVBT44YJ2JGKZ9JZ5HRD1A5` remains typed evidence of the too-short readiness cap. VPN geography alone remains inadmissible. | HIGH ⭐ |

Its canonical route is admitted only when one serialized storefront `i18n` object binds `country=US`, `market=market-us`, and `currency=USD`; loose dollar, offer, or `buyerCountry` signals do not count. | `US_USD_DEFAULT_STOREFRONT_CONFIRMED_DELIVERY_LOCATION_UNPINNED`; live Pearfat PDP packet `01KXRG2C722GPTCVF6V8MFR4Y5` passed with `pin_confirmed=true`, no proxy/profile/storage-state/geo-IP/credential. Separate origin-derived `buyerCountry=SG` remained visible. | HIGH ⭐ |

Admission requires the final Sephora page to bind `Sephora.renderQueryParams.country=US` and a Sephora-sold JSON-LD `Offer` with `priceCurrency=USD`; the plugin performs no preference mutation. | `US_USD_STOREFRONT_CONFIRMED_DELIVERY_LOCATION_UNPINNED`; live Tower 28 LipSoftie packet `01KXRZQJBKNKC91SXH2C7MKF1C` passed with `pin_confirmed=true`, no proxy/profile/storage-state/geo-IP/credential. Projection anchored product `P509397` and USD offer SKU `2843068`; the known Sephora review-count residual remained explicit. | HIGH ⭐ |

The commissioned assertion required `window.__LOCALE__='en-US'`, one source node binding `data-locale="en_US"` with `data-currency="USD"`, and JSON-LD Product SKU `2645443` with a nonempty USD offer. | `NO_GO_REQUIRED_RENDERED_MARKET_SIGNALS_ABSENT`; the bound product, SKU, USD offer, price, and 671-review state rendered, but the locale assignment and `data-locale` signal did not. The typed packet was preserved with `pin_confirmed=false`; the unproven adapter/flag was removed and no projection or pin was promoted. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Ulta US/USD storefront assertion recovery without proxy | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; implementation at `forseti-harness/source_capture/adapters/ulta_us_market.py` and `run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py --ulta-market US`; verified PDP packet `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\b6e\01KXWQW45J2C17RX4397Z27KYJ` | Fresh read of the historical raw DOM identified the actual first-party names: root `lang=en-US`, `window.__APP_LOCALE__='en-US'`, GraphQL `ultasite=en-us`, and a product `square-placement` joining `data-consumer-locale=en_US`, `data-currency=USD`, and amount. Admission additionally binds exact URL SKU `2645443` to its Product JSON-LD nonempty USD offer. The assertion mutates no preference. | `GO_US_USD_STOREFRONT_CONFIRMED_OFF_VPN`; the canonical Night Shift PDP retained exact `www.ulta.com`, `pin_confirmed=true`, no access block, subject/price/review sufficiency, and four fresh-matched hashes. Retail/PDP projection anchored the exact SKU/USD offer and 671-review / 4.3-rating substrate with zero residuals. `.com`, dollar glyph, HTML language alone, and VPN geography remain inadmissible substitutes. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Walmart US storefront without proxy | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; failed live packet `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\1cf\01KXSV9HFFEPNEXVA407318KW1` | Anonymous Direct HTTP on canonical Vitamasques item `2150828728` with `walmart_pdp_aggregate`. Admission required one `initialData.data` object to bind URL/product item, exact USD currency, equal page/product postal state, and an immediate targeting scalar `countryCode=="US"`. | `NO_GO_REQUIRED_SIGNAL_SHAPE_MISMATCH`; item, USD, postal `95829`, and profile sufficiency passed, but the retailer serialized immediate `countryCode=["US"]`. The typed packet was preserved with `pin_confirmed=false`; list membership was not substituted for scalar equality, the unproven flag was removed, and no pin or projection was promoted. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Walmart US/USD storefront assertion recovery without proxy | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; implementation at `forseti-harness/source_capture/adapters/walmart_us_market.py` and `run_source_capture_http_packet.py --walmart-market US`; verified PDP packet `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\920\01KXWY75J4419N85NAXPXGZG8Q` | Fresh read of the historical raw `__NEXT_DATA__` confirmed Walmart serializes the immediate module targeting country as exact `["US"]`. Recovery admits scalar `"US"` or only that exact single-item list, while retaining the same item-ID, exact USD, equal-postal, final-host, and profile gates. The assertion mutates no preference or location. The generic Retail/PDP projector now recognizes Direct HTTP's preserved body as HTML input. | `GO_US_USD_STOREFRONT_CONFIRMED_OFF_VPN_ORIGIN_LOCATION_UNPINNED`; the canonical Vitamasques PDP retained exact `www.walmart.com`, HTTP 200, `pin_confirmed=true`, slice pins `US` / `USD`, item `2150828728`, and fresh-matched raw hashes. Projection `01KXWY7K99EPG92XW2GZ6BTTH0` anchored one product and one item `2150828728` offer at `2.97` USD. Postal `95829` remains origin-derived, and inventory, sold-units, delivery-pin, and review-substrate residuals remain explicit. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Target US delivery ZIP without proxy | Live Naturium grid packets `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\27d\01KXRK26RMXSBSEGVP8BKRG9GX` and `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\3d6\01KXRKJNQZCMKM6ATV55B0AYG5` | Generic homepage setup could not open the public ZIP control. A bounded retry on the commissioned grid completed the retailer-UI steps and rendered header `Ship to location: 10001`, but the same page retained top-level and nested `serverLocationVariables` ZIP `52404` with country `US`. | `NO_GO_SPLIT_LOCATION_SIGNAL`; header-only application does not confirm the commissioned conjunction. Both typed packets were preserved, the PDP was not attempted, the unproven adapter was reverted, and the registry remains `OBSERVED_US_CONTEXT_UNPINNED` / `OBSERVED_LOCATION_UNPINNED` / `OBSERVED_USD_UNPINNED`. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Target US delivery ZIP recovery without proxy | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; failed grid packets `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\66c\01KXSX9FXXEVTFSXF9DKYWKW1T` and `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\bd9\01KXSXGCKNJQCRKNPYDPY944HY` | Recovery correctly separated shipping header state from store/pickup ZIP. Anonymous ephemeral CloakBrowser attempted the public grid header control with a 30-second setup window; the corrected attempt added a five-second render settle, six-second capture settle, and one scroll pass. | `NO_GO_PUBLIC_ZIP_CONTROL_NOT_INTERACTABLE_DURING_BOUNDED_SETUP`; both attempts stopped at `open_zip_control`. The final captured DOM later contained `#zip-code-id-btn` with shipping `52404` and country/store context `US` / `52404`, so this is an interaction-timing/interactability failure, not control absence. The PDP and projections were not attempted, the unproven route was removed, and no pin was promoted. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Target US delivery ZIP with bounded readiness and scoped form submission | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; implementation at `forseti-harness/source_capture/adapters/target_delivery_location.py` and `run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py --target-zip 10001`; verified grid/PDP packets `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\a37\01KXWMQWHRABBSA5HN3CMR9TNS` / `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\981\01KXWMXEYB58SMVSJT80XJAP9D` | Instrumented retries separated three phases: the earlier route missed the late control; the first new packet opened it but missed the visible input; the second filled the scoped input but found no recognized visible action. The admitted route waits once for visible `#zip-code-id-btn`, scopes visible ZIP input/action selectors to Target's dialog/ZipCode component, and permits Enter only on that already-scoped input. Post-submit admission still requires completed UI setup, exact shipping header/child ZIP `10001`, and Target-owned country `US`; store ZIP remains separate. | `GO_TARGET_US_ZIP_10001_CONFIRMED_OFF_VPN`; both commissioned Naturium surfaces retained `www.target.com`, exact shipping/server ZIP `10001`, `country=US`, separate store ZIP `10011`, subject/product/price sufficiency, no access block, and `pin_confirmed=true`. Existing grid/PDP projections anchored 24 Naturium products plus the bound Target offer/review substrate. Currency remains `OBSERVED_USD_UNPINNED`. The owner-commissioned VPN homepage differential was not triggered because the direct off-VPN route confirmed the pin. | HIGH ⭐ |
| Kohl's US/USD storefront access diagnosis | `docs/research/forseti_beauty_retailer_surface_probe_results_v0.md`; Direct HTTP PDP `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\fbe\01KXT0245PZBHZSYJHM5376BCA`, cold CloakBrowser PDP `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\64f\01KXT04HA0TT33RH7BAWQ38H58`, Direct HTTP FAQ `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\e64\01KXT09ERZ6584J7M4J07WS706`, humanized homepage-warmed FAQ/PDP `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\ace\01KXT3432PEF0NXEZE0VWEWMMD` / `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\039\01KXT38WKZMXVMMY18CDX3SC66`, header-complete HTTP PDP/policy `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\f77\01KXTZ76J5BGQJTEP2QDCZDYHY` / `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\037\01KXTZ77WYTPH15N1F8XNK87HC`, owner-operated US consumer-VPN CloakBrowser block PDP/policy `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\2d3\01KXXBP2HTK718ZS9CZ11CQJX0` / `F:\forseti-data-lake\raw\ba1\01KXXBVY7RTBSHN651P124X0E8` | Packet-backed ordinary and header-complete HTTP returned typed 403 block shells on both bound routes. Canonical/bare/mobile host, `/api/amp`, typeahead, and anonymous first-party app/config candidates were explored only as unpreserved scouting and carry no Capture Spine verdict. Cold and homepage-warmed anonymous CloakBrowser also rendered Akamai `Access Denied`. A separate scouting browser reached both commissioned routes, proving route liveness but not isolating exit IP from browser/TLS identity. A 2026-07-19 owner-operated US consumer-VPN run (Surfshark WireGuard, US/New York datacenter exit `AS60068 Datacamp`) preserved CloakBrowser Akamai block packets on both bound routes; a matched in-app visible-browser control on the SAME exit was also Akamai-denied, which was read at the time as isolating exit-IP reputation as the block cause (CORRECTED 2026-07-19, below). Owner-directed follow-up headed-CloakBrowser scouting (stealth+humanize) was Akamai-denied on both the US datacenter VPN and the normal SG residential connection; but a warmed real Chrome (personal profile via CDP) then reached full content over the SG residential IP — the bound LipSoftie PDP at `$16.00` / `priceCurrency USD` and the US-shipping-only policy — falsifying the exit-IP/browser-independent reading. The discriminator is the warmed real-browser Akamai session; cold/automation browsers are denied on every egress tested and the reproducible Capture Spine route stays NO_GO (not runner-reproducible, no pin). No registered US residential profile or entitled retailer feed was available. | `NO_GO_CAPTURE_SPINE_RUNNER_AKAMAI_BOT_BLOCKED_ANY_EGRESS; SUBJECT_CONTENT_REACHED_ONLY_VIA_WARMED_REAL_BROWSER_NOT_RUNNER_REPRODUCIBLE` (2026-07-19; retracts the earlier `...EXIT_IP_REPUTATION_BROWSER_INDEPENDENT` token, which a warmed real-browser session falsified); no projection, adapter, API surface, or pin was promoted. Search-indexed pages, `.com`, dollar glyphs, archive/cache, proxy geography, and the unpreserved scouting matrix are not current pin proof. A further admissible probe requires materially different external state: a registered US residential (non-datacenter) route, entitled Kohl's affiliate feed, or owner-approved paid provider — the owner-operated US consumer-VPN datacenter route was tried 2026-07-19 and is now an exhausted, browser-independent Akamai denial; exact retailer-owned US policy plus bound `USD` offer evidence remains mandatory. | HIGH ⭐ |

A fail-closed assertion joined only `Shopify.country=US`, only active `Shopify.currency=USD`, and exactly one route-bound Product JSON-LD object with named Tower 28 brand and nonempty priced USD offers. The generic Retail/PDP projector selects the Product-SKU-matching offer from a valid JSON-LD `offers` array and recognizes the exact server-rendered Yotpo block. Raw PDP state separately preserves all three variants, subscription allocations, ingredients, and packaging language. The existing rendered-widget companion passively preserved Yotpo's five-row `sort=rating,date,images,badge` response and one bounded ten-row `sort=date` response; no new runner was added. | `GO_US_USD_DEFAULT_STOREFRONT_CONFIRMED_WITHOUT_VPN_DELIVERY_UNPINNED`; corrected PDP projection `01KXX3P3PPQV3625JKFDGA3JY7` anchored selected SKU `210000007835` at `12.0` USD, aggregate `4.705247/5` from 648, and 10/10 server-rendered bodies. Coverage-v1 review projection `01KXX6RCN8C2XTH3JZF055RMSJ` preserved ten date-sorted bodies, nine verified flags, five loyalty-points incentivized flags, and nine reviewer-declared age ranges. Both ten-row views remain bounded subsets; the review packet's legacy `fragrance_review` family name is typed and makes no category claim. No new runner, projection schema, or retailer enum was added. | HIGH ⭐ |

Public diagnostic parsed metadata but stopped on a visible slider challenge before comment capture. Sessioned warm-probe plan still requires dedicated non-personal account, human login, per-operation network approval, account-ban risk acceptance, no secrets in packets, public content only, packet-grade response capture, and stop-on-challenge. Transcript/audio/ASR and durable media/video are not proven. | HIGH ⭐ |

**IG reel view/play count (2026-06-14).** Closes part of the prior IG recon's "reel view/play count (in GraphQL JSON, not page DOM)" residual and **refines** its "`web_profile_info` API 429 cookieless → 200 logged-in" line: in a real browser context (IG's `X-IG-App-ID`/web headers) `web_profile_info` returned **200 cookieless** carrying `video_view_count` per media, keyed by `shortcode`; the earlier 429 was the **header-less `direct_http`** rung, not a browser-context XHR. The signal lives in the **profile feed**, not the reel page, so a build folds into the **existing logged-out grid load** — not a per-reel or session capture. **IG reel view/play count — corrected (2026-06-14).** First reported "walls early" from a UI-scroll probe; that was an **artifact** (a DOM login-heuristic that fired regardless of auth, and `mouse.wheel` never triggering IG's infinite-scroll — identical logged-out/session results were the tell — recon **Pattern 1**). The valid method, **following the grid's own `end_cursor` via the `graphql/query`**, paginated **25 pages all `200`, 365 media back to 2017-08-22**, **logged-out**, no wall / no `429`; the **session run was byte-identical** → session buys nothing. Net: `video_view_count` is reachable **logged-out incl. deep history**; the session lane is **retired** for this purpose. **One residual:** sustained cadence at scale (H5 / multi-account-over-time).

**IG creator discovery — suggested-accounts edge (2026-06-15).** Discovery mechanism 1 (the
rising-creator spine) for the IG creator-momentum pipeline is **GO logged-out**: the
related-accounts graph is `data.user.edge_related_profiles` in `web_profile_info` — the **same
tolerant 200-cookieless surface** as calls/stats/reel-views — so the whole pipeline runs on
**one IG substrate**, no off-IG discovery DB and no session. Populated logged-out (19 and 32
related accounts for two seeds; **sub-niche-coherent** — a fragrance seed returns fragrance
accounts), each node carrying `username`+`id` so the **snowball is feasible**. One empty seed
(`hyram`) coincided with the **crawler-strip / login-wall variant** (bundle flag
`should_remove_related_profiles_for_crawlers`) or an account opt-out — a known empties source
for Phase 2 to detect-and-retry, **not** a reachability failure. **Phase 2 (bounded snowball,
2026-06-15): GO mechanics, two design requirements.** Pure-wpi (no profile nav) sidesteps the
strip; 15 reads all 200 (wpi ceiling ≥15); 15 fetches → **243 unique accounts**, 69 multi-set →
bounded community. But (a) **sub-niche coherence degrades at depth** via bridge nodes (one
`@Bible` relation injected a religious cluster) → a **sub-niche filter is now GATING**, not
polish; and (b) a **mega seed surfaces only mid-tier** (≥184k), so the rising tier (~10k–100k)
needs deeper snowball. Production at-scale + the discovery-read posture remain open.
`ig_creator_discovery_suggested_accounts_recon_v0.md` is the finding;
`ig_creator_discovery_spec_v0.md` is the capability spec.

**TikTok sessioned DOM/hydration update (2026-06-30).** A later same-lane
receipt, `docs/workflows/tiktok_sessioned_dom_hydration_profile_comments_receipt_v0.md`,
extends the partial TikTok state: one sessioned Chrome TikTok tab, no duplicate
TikTok tabs, public content only, no session-secret reads/writes, profile
hydration + stable DOM selectors, 95 `user-post-item` / `video-views` nodes, 94
unique profile-grid video anchors, pinned-video `webapp.video-detail` hydration,
and 20 visible top-level comment DOM rows without visible login/slider/verify
markers. It still does **not** capture `/api/comment/list` response bodies, so
sessioned packet fields (`cid`, `uid`, exact comment `create_time`, cursor,
`has_more`), exact grid-view normalization, per-account ceiling, transcript/ASR,
and durable media remain unproven. A same-day existing-Chrome follow-up confirmed
the pinned video and comments render cleanly in the logged-in user Chrome
session, but the current Chrome-extension surface exposes only `pageAssets`
(static/media asset inventory), not XHR/fetch response bodies, and its read-only
page scope lacks resource-timing access. Treat more Chrome-extension DOM probing
as non-packet-grade; the next proof must use a supported response-body capture
surface for the page-owned `/api/comment/list` request.

**TikTok Funmi N30 comment/subtitle cadence + batch admission update (2026-07-01).**
`docs/workflows/tiktok_funmi_n30_comment_subtitle_cadence_analysis_v0.md`
supersedes the response-body-unmeasured part of the prior Funmi sessioned
state for one creator/session: 30/30 videos completed with page-owned
`/api/comment/list` parsed fields, 0 challenges, 0 failures, and no raw
response body or endpoint persistence. Source-native WebVTT subtitles parsed
for 26/26 videos where `subtitleInfos` existed; the other 4/30 lacked
`subtitleInfos`. A durable sanitized parsed-batch SourceCapturePacket now exists
at `F:\orca-data-lake\raw\97c\01KWCYZ9P72W4SJD7NDPRQT0DB` with source surface
`tiktok_creator_batch_comment_subtitle_admission`, preserving 596 parsed comment
rows, 1044 WebVTT cues, and deterministic typed extraction seeds. This does not
prove cross-creator coverage, higher-volume account safety, full comment census,
durable media/video preservation, final product extraction, or platform-wide
subtitle availability.

## Coverage map

- **Well-covered:** forums/threads (Reddit ×4, WSO), pricing (M&I, Teal, OpenAI-lane), archive/history (Daimler, Unity), docs-PDF body (Daimler — the strongest anti-bot escalation case), browser runner (CloakBrowser), reviews (ClickUp + Sephora-pending).
- **Thin / single-fixture:** docs-changelog (Kubernetes only), reviews (one merged fixture; the strong one is worktree-pending), SPA embedded-state (Ulta worktree-pending only).
- **ABSENT / PARTIAL — directly relevant to the stated multi-source product direction:**
  **TikTok is no longer absent, but remains partial.** First-slice TikTok recon and a sessioned
  capture spec/warm-probe plan now exist (see Social networks table), proving route existence for
  public page-owned metadata and top/relevant comment responses in a real cookied browser while
  leaving sessioned detection ceiling, scale reliability, durable media/video, cross-creator subtitle coverage,
  final product extraction, and projection implementation unproven. Parsed batch packet admission is now proven for Funmi N30. **YouTube is now probed** (2026-06-21 — **GO**,
  n=10 logged-out; long-form + Shorts unified, served-HTML embedded state + `youtubei` comments;
  see the Social networks table). **Instagram is now probed** (own-account
  wind-caller recon, reel view/play count, creator discovery, and a 2026-06-29 public deep-capture
  transcript diagnostic; see the Social networks table). The only other social probe is the
  LinkedIn *policy* boundary. Social surfaces carry the heaviest ToS/auth-wall/anti-bot posture
  (entitlement gate, Pattern 4, applies before any technical attempt). Full durable media/video
  preservation is still unprobed for IG; the deep-capture diagnostic proves only transient handle
  use for immediate ASR, not stored media bytes.

## Non-claims

Not an authorization, not a build spec, not validation/readiness/acceptance, not legal
advice. Verdicts are as reported by each source doc. TikTok's first-slice route is no
longer absent, but scale reliability, sessioned detection ceiling, cross-creator
subtitle/transcript coverage, durable media/video, final product extraction, and
projection remain unproven. Parsed Funmi N30 batch packet admission is proven.
