This directory is the current Capture home for Retail/PDP source-family
artifacts. It does not imply a Scanning sibling exists.

Phase sibling status: no accepted
`forseti/product/spines/scanning/source_families/retail_pdp/` directory exists in
this worktree. If a Scanning Retail/PDP source family is later created, add the
cross-pointer here and in the Scanning family entrypoint.

## Capture-To-Lake Route Map

| Layer | Current home | What to confirm |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Access / method | `retailer_information_extraction_standard_v0.md`; `retail_pdp_content_cleaning_contract_v0.md` | Cross-retailer evidence categories and discovery behavior; retailer-owned extraction, retention, target binding, residuals, Cleaning, and Silver handoff. |
| Storefront pins | `retail_storefront_pin_registry_v0.md`; `amazon_us_vpn_regression_recovery_playbook_v0.md`; supporting recon and live receipts linked there | Session, storefront-country, currency, and delivery-location state independently; a working route, VPN geography, or observed context is not a confirmed pin. |
| Retail/PDP packet/content | `run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py`; `source_capture/retail_pdp_content.py`; `cleaning/retail_pdp.py` | Five admitted profiles default to canonical content after retailer-owned pin/access/sufficiency/extraction gates. Amazon remains an explicit raw-unflipped route consumed through the legacy raw decoder into the same Cleaning/Silver floor. Shallow ladder profiles derive the commissioned PDP/search identity from the URL and require their exact US pin input; historical canary names are not target evidence. |
| Retail grid packet/projection | `run_source_capture_cloakbrowser_packet.py`; `source_capture/sephora_brand_grid.py`; `source_capture/retail_grid_projection.py`; `docs/research/forseti_sephora_brand_grid_capture_live_proof_v0.md` | Raw remains authoritative. Sephora, Ulta, and Target have admitted brand/assortment-grid projections with retailer-specific bounds; Amazon has an admitted query-bound ranked-search projection complete only for its declared query and reachable result window, never as a guaranteed complete or authorized-only brand denominator. Projection capability does not admit a live route. |
| Portfolio breadth composition | `run_retail_portfolio_onboarding.py`; `source_capture/retail_portfolio_onboarding.py` | Compose the owned source-parent census, company-owned official retailer board, selected retailer set and working primary, every verified grid row's explicit parent/listing reconciliation, and one hash-verified raw Retail/PDP packet per exact non-bundle retailer listing. Optional evidence-backed family mappings distinguish normalized product families, variant-as-parent objects, bundles/sets, and non-products without name/category inference. The derived record preserves duplicate placements, ambiguity, unmatched rows, missing material variants, unresolved family identity, and route failures without granting false parent or family coverage. |
| Retail/PDP Silver | `retail_pdp_silver_producer_contract_v0.md`; `run_retail_pdp_silver_producer.py`; `source_capture/retail_pdp_silver.py` | Cleaning-owned source anchors, retailer-local identity, and source-visible offer/review observations only. |
| Fragrance purchase-review row capture | `fragrance_purchase_review_*` docs in this folder; `run_fragrance_review_coverage.py`; `run_fragrance_review_discovery.py`; `run_fragrance_review_lake_packet.py`; `forseti-harness/source_capture/fragrance_review_lake.py` | Retailer review-positive PDP discovery, rendered/widget companion preservation, focused coverage, and preserved-body lake tee boundaries. |
| Data Lake authority | `forseti/product/spines/data_lake/README.md` -> `authority/` | Raw admission, path grammar, derived layout, and Silver semantics. The family index does not own them. |

## Portfolio Breadth Composition

The portfolio compositor is a local, no-network coverage gate. Its JSON
commission names the owned census packet and parents; a company-owned
authorization row for each retailer considered, including an explicit Sephora
resolution; any nonempty selected subset of officially named retailers; the
working primary; one explicit reconciliation for every row in each captured grid
packet; and the raw Retail/PDP packet directory for every exact non-bundle
retailer listing. A route-complete, officially named Sephora must be selected and
primary. An officially named but blocked, unpinned, or incomplete Sephora remains
a typed selected outcome while another route-complete retailer may be the
working primary. Captured outcomes point to packet
directories, not trusted projection summaries: the compositor re-hashes raw
bytes and rebuilds the retailer projection. Baseline packet locators must bind
the stable retailer-native product identity and any explicitly commissioned
retailer variant; fulfillment, market, or tracking parameters are not product
identity. The HTTPS scheme and matching retailer host remain part of the route
binding. Retailer-variant binding is currently admitted only where the route
exposes a stable selected identifier (Sephora, Target, and Ulta); commissions
that bind it for another retailer fail closed.

Source-parent count is never a normalized product-family count. A commission
may supply evidence-referenced family members and non-family dispositions for
the compositor to validate, but the compositor does not infer them from names,
URLs, or categories. Unmapped parents remain typed unresolved objects. They do
not block portfolio composition, but they keep the family denominator
`PARTIAL` and the complete normalized-family count unavailable.

Run `python runners/run_retail_portfolio_onboarding.py --commission <json>
--output <json>` from `forseti-harness/`. The derived output is
write-once and does not alter Raw. It is a coverage-composition record, not a
new CSB ledger schema, global SKU graph, sales estimate, or product-role
selection.

## Non-Claims

This entrypoint is not live capture authorization, validation, readiness,
source completeness, ECR, Cleaning, Judgment, buyer proof, demand proof, or
commercial-readiness evidence.
