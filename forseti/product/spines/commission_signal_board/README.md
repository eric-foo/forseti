  - Commissioning an Understanding or Problem Framing phase of a Forseti Intelligence Cycle.
  - Checking which CSB artifacts are canonical after the spine-first pilot authorization.

Naming note: **Prompt Structure** is the runnable CSB prompt/template. **Prompt Structure Rules** is the durable authority/rules doc for that prompt structure. File paths now use role-aligned names.

## Commission Profiles And Time Postures

CSB keeps the existing `mode: backtest | forward` axis unchanged and adds two
orthogonal fields:

- `commission_profile: standard_signal_board | company_competitive_intelligence`;
- `time_posture: recency_first | longitudinal`.

`recency_first` is the universal default and uses the canonical prompt's
deterministic 0-30, 31-90, 91-180, and over-180-day ladder. `longitudinal` is an
explicit override only for change, recurrence, or trajectory across a declared
period and requires both the period and rationale. A named event is a route or
query inside one of these two postures, not another posture.

A commission for one company subject defaults to
`company_competitive_intelligence` when the subject is a Brand or Org, including
an unresolved Brand/Org identity. That profile produces the conditional
ten-section company report and no demand-classifier handoff. Other commissions
continue to use the existing standard Sections 1-10 and classifier handoff.

## Forseti Intelligence Cycle

Future one-company intelligence work is commissioned as a **Forseti
Intelligence Cycle**, not by an unqualified `Phase 1` or `Phase 2` label. Its
canonical phases are **Understanding** and **Problem Framing**, in that order.
Each phase normally uses two completed operator/model turns:

1. **Acquire & Seal** — bind the phase question and intended use, resolve
   canonical source routes before capture, run authorized Scanning/Capture, and
   preserve the resulting route receipts, provenance, failures, and seal state
   in a durable phase artifact.
2. **Deliver** — start in fresh context from that artifact, verify its
   acquisition gate, then synthesize and hand off without claiming evidence,
   coverage, provenance, or route exhaustion the seal does not support.

Acquire & Seal optimizes for decision-useful completeness under the integrity
floor; compactness, actor count, and token minimization are not its success
criteria. Deliver then applies Smallest Complete Intervention to the human
artifact without dropping decisive evidence or limitations.

For current US consumer-beauty Understanding, the playbook binds the default
four-evidence-actor route: `CO0` plus exactly `CO1`, `CO2`, and mandatory `CO3`.
`CO3` always owns customer/community and selected depth; its depth expands
adaptively, but the actor and customer-understanding job are not optional.

Two turns are the normal budget, not permission to convert a blocked acquisition
into apparent completion. The playbook owns the full contract and the six
non-numeric outcome signals. Historical artifact names containing `phase1` or
`Phase 1` remain historically accurate provenance and are not executable names
for a future cycle.

## Legacy Non-Controlling Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Current authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forseti/product/spines/commission_signal_board/dispatch_rules/forseti_demand_gate_run_commission_criteria_v0.md` | Historical only; not a live CSB dispatch rule | Use the CSB prompt and playbook. CSB is an evidence/signals-only board and must not emit admit/hold/fail gate verdicts. |

## Boundaries

CSB owns commission profiles, source-family requirements, time posture, and
typed gaps/requests. Scanning owns the intelligent walk, exact-query and
category-aware hidden-venue discovery, negatives, access notes, and frontier
closeout. Capture owns lawful source access and preservation adapters. CSB does
not contain venue or research modules and does not fake either downstream act.
CSB defines material information jobs and candidate routes; it does not freeze a
participant packet, decide final inclusion, or declare acquisition complete.
Every included item needs a named decision-material job and no equal-or-better
included substitute.

For recurring or actively radarred source families, CSB routes a lake-first
preflight before external Scanning or Capture: relevant Silver/current view,
then packet or catalog inventory, then raw material when needed. Lake inspection
tests reuse, freshness, and coverage only. It is not proof of current external
reality; absence from Silver is not absence from the lake or the world, and a
missing read model does not block acquisition.

This spine does not authorize retrieval, scraping, capture, graph construction,
demand classification, forecasting, judgment, buyer proof, validation,
readiness, CI, hook wiring, or runtime work. Public-reaction engagement belongs
in CSB as resonance/routing context only; the authority and prompt artifacts keep
it separate from proof, Commit/Scale support, graph weight, classifier mapping,
final resonance weight, and Action Ceiling.

The executable validator remains at
`.agents/hooks/check_commission_signal_board_output.py`. The executable tests
and fixtures remain under `forseti-harness/tests/`.

Company reports remain one-company-at-a-time and decision-neutral. They may use
bounded comparator pointers to interpret the subject, but deep competitor
treatment requires a separately named follow-up commission. Their Company
Surface ledger is candidate-only: no import, identity resolution, stored
corpus, or Company Surface mutation occurs in CSB.

## Old Paths

The old CSB doc paths under `docs/` are absent on current `main`. Use the
