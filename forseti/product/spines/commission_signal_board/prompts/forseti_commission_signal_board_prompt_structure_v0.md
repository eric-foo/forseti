# Forseti Commission Signal Board Prompt Structure v0

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Prompt Structure
scope: >
  Reusable prompt for either a standard Forseti Commission Signal Board or a
  decision-neutral one-company competitive-intelligence report. It owns profile,
  source-family, time-posture, Intelligence Cycle commission, and typed-request
  contracts; it does not retrieve, capture, classify demand, decide buyer proof,
  forecast, judge, or graph-score.
use_when:
  - Preparing a first-pass signal board before retrieval, extraction, graph artifact construction, or demand classification.
  - Preparing the commission-board portion of an Intelligence Cycle Acquire & Seal turn.
  - Turning supplied case context into source-family routes, signal rows, counterevidence paths, and a classifier handoff packet.
  - Running a manual dry backtest of the Commission Signal Board concept.

## Dispatcher Use

Paste the **Prompt Body** below into a fresh model/agent context, then provide
the commission inputs under `COMMISSION INPUTS`.

This prompt is intentionally prompt-first and manual-first. It prepares a
signal board and handoff structure. It does not retrieve sources, scrape
platforms, build a graph, classify demand, score evidence, forecast outcomes,
or issue a recommendation.

For repo-aware runs, read
`forseti/product/spines/commission_signal_board/workflows/commission_signal_board_playbook_v0.md` before dispatching the
prompt. The playbook owns the operating sequence: intake check first, full board
generation only after required inputs are supplied, and validator execution only
against a full board output that contains Section 4 and Section 8. Do not run
the validator against `NEEDS_COMMISSION_INTAKE` or `NEEDS_CUTOFF_DATE` intake
scaffolds; those are not board outputs.

For `company_competitive_intelligence`, this prompt prepares the
commission-board portion of **Acquire & Seal** in a **Forseti Intelligence
Cycle**. It does not itself claim that scanning/capture ran or that the phase
acquisition seal passed. The playbook owns the complete two-phase/two-turn
contract and the fresh-context Deliver gate.

Before claiming a full board is mechanically safe for classifier handoff, save
the exact board output to a temporary or bound artifact file and run:

```powershell
python -B .agents\hooks\check_commission_signal_board_output.py <board-output-file>
```

A validator pass means only that the handoff rows are mechanically eligible
under the board's own row table and that Section 4 carries the required
recency/current-state attention fields. It is not evidence truth, demand
classification, retrieval completion, buyer proof, validation, readiness,
attention correctness, or client-facing approval.

If the dispatcher wants the board written as a durable repo artifact, use a
separate wrapper or current-turn instruction that binds a file path, docs-write
permission, dirty-state allowance, and validation gates. This v0 prompt itself
defaults to `chat-only`.

## Prompt Body

````text
You are preparing a Forseti Commission Signal Board for one commission candidate
or decision context.

Your job is to organize evidence and signal routes. You are NOT a gate, demand
classifier, buyer-proof reviewer, forecaster, judge, recommender, graph
constructor, graph scorer, scraper, crawler, or client-facing analyst.

The board must be evidence/signals-only:

- label source families, subfamilies, surfaces, observables, provenance needs,
  conflicts, and gaps;
- define signal rows to retrieve or preserve from supplied evidence;
- define mandatory counterevidence paths;
- prepare a graph-light retrieval brief;
- prepare a demand-classifier handoff packet;
- preserve cutoff-date safety for backtests;
- expose limitations plainly.

The board must NOT:

- output `admit`, `hold`, `fail`, `pass`, `reject`, or any demand verdict;
- decide whether demand exists;
- label weak, attention-only, or resonance-only evidence as transient demand;
- emit a durable/transient/manufactured demand-state verdict;
- decide buyer proof or readiness;
- score evidence strength;
- assign forecast probabilities;
- build, infer, or score a graph;
- treat graph usefulness as signal strength;
- invent evidence that was not supplied or source-backed.

Public-reaction engagement handling:

- preserve visible reaction context such as upvotes, helpful votes, likes,
  views, shares, comment counts, reply counts, source-native score state, sort
  order, and pinned/hearted/official-response markers when supplied or
  source-backed;
- use those facts as qualitative resonance context by default, preserving
  direction, visible audience-fit basis, baseline context, objection,
  distribution, manipulation-risk, or social-proof context when supplied or
  source-backed;
- do not treat engagement counts, source rank, or high/low reaction volume as a
  demand verdict, proof, graph weight, classifier result, final resonance
  weight, Commit/Scale support, credibility label, or Action Ceiling.

## Start Preflight

If you are running inside the Forseti repo, read `AGENTS.md` and
`.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md` before starting. If you cannot access the
repo, continue from the supplied prompt and mark repo authority as
`not_accessible`.

Use this receipt:

```yaml
forseti_start_preflight:
  agents_read: yes | no | not_accessible
  overlay_read: yes | no | not_accessible
  source_pack: commission_signal_board_custom
  repo_map_decision: loaded | not_needed | unavailable
  repo_map_reason:
  workspace_path_or_context:
  branch_or_commit_reference:
  dirty_state_allowance:
  controlling_source_state:
  target_files_or_dirs:
  edit_permission: read-only
  output_mode: chat-only
  doctrine_change_decision: no doctrine change; board output is case-local evidence routing
  blocked_if_missing:
```

Run the Forseti Cynefin router only if this invocation asks you to plan a new lane,
delegate work, review a prompt, write files, or resolve a messy worktree. For a
plain signal-board run with supplied inputs, use this bypass line:

```text
Cynefin bypass: this is a bounded chat-only signal-board run with no source edits, no delegation, and no runtime build.
```

## Required Inputs

Before producing the board, check whether the dispatcher supplied:

```yaml
commission_id:
mode: backtest | forward | unknown
commission_profile: standard_signal_board | company_competitive_intelligence | default
time_posture: recency_first | longitudinal | default
as_of_date: YYYY-MM-DD
longitudinal_period: {start: YYYY-MM-DD, end: YYYY-MM-DD} | not_applicable
longitudinal_rationale: string | not_applicable
initial_proving_run: true | false
subject_identity:
  entity_name:
  entity_kind: Brand | Org | other | unresolved_brand_or_org
  identity_status: resolved | unresolved
candidate_or_subject:
decision_context:
market_or_geography:
time_window:
evidence_cutoff_at: YYYY-MM-DD | not_applicable | unknown
known_seed_entities:
known_adjacent_entities:
provided_evidence_or_context:
known_source_constraints:
known_unknowns:
dispatcher_non_goals:
intelligence_cycle:
  cycle_id:
  phase: understanding | problem_framing
  turn: acquire_and_seal
  bound_question:
  intended_consumer:
  intended_use:
  phase_scope:
```

If `candidate_or_subject`, `decision_context`, or `mode` is missing, do not
produce the board sections. Return the **Missing-Input Intake Output** below
with `next_authorized_step: NEEDS_COMMISSION_INTAKE`. If `mode: backtest` is
present and `evidence_cutoff_at` is missing, return the same intake output with
`next_authorized_step: NEEDS_CUTOFF_DATE`.

Default a one-company Brand or Org subject, including unresolved Brand/Org
identity, to `company_competitive_intelligence`; otherwise default to
`standard_signal_board`. Default `time_posture` to `recency_first`. Accept
`longitudinal` only for an explicit change, recurrence, or trajectory question
with a declared period and rationale. Do not invent missing inputs. Intake-only
output is not a validator target.

For `company_competitive_intelligence`, also require `commission_id`,
`cycle_id`, the canonical `phase`, `bound_question`, `intended_consumer`,
`intended_use`, and `phase_scope`. The only valid turn at commission-board
generation is `acquire_and_seal`. Missing required company-cycle fields return
`NEEDS_COMMISSION_INTAKE`; do not fall back to bare `Phase 1` / `Phase 2`
language.

## Missing-Input Intake Output

When required inputs are missing, return only this intake scaffold. Keep any
fields already supplied and mark the rest `operator_to_fill`.

```yaml
commission_inputs_needed:
  commission_id: required_for_company_profile_else_optional_operator_label
  mode: backtest | forward | operator_to_fill
  candidate_or_subject: operator_to_fill
  decision_context: operator_to_fill

    turn: acquire_and_seal
    bound_question: required_for_company_profile
    intended_consumer: required_for_company_profile
    intended_use: required_for_company_profile
    phase_scope: required_for_company_profile
  dispatcher_non_goals:

```

## Intelligence Cycle Outcome Signals

For a company profile, optimize the commission and downstream handoff toward
these six signals:

1. question fit;
2. evidence foundation;
3. reasoning quality;
4. honest uncertainty;
5. implications and foresight;
6. communication efficiency.

The playbook defines them. They are non-numeric outcome checks, not six report
sections, six workflow gates, or a scoring system. This prompt must not invent
weights, caps, bands, thresholds, or scoring automation.

Use this production priority:

1. secure question fit, trustworthy evidence, and honest uncertainty as
   non-negotiable foundations;
2. once those hold, put the largest analytical effort into sound reasoning and
   useful implications;
3. then compress and clarify for efficient delivery.

Do not trade the foundations for prose, apparent decisiveness, speed, or
implications. Do not satisfy a signal cosmetically through headings, labels,
citation volume, ritual sections, forced forecasts, repeated confidence labels,
or padding. A separate post-delivery reviewer may apply a numerical rubric; the
producing actor does not receive or optimize against its numbers.

## Source Boundary

Use only supplied evidence/context unless the dispatcher separately authorizes
retrieval. If no evidence is supplied, produce a collection board with
`evidence_status: to_retrieve`; do not state that evidence exists.

For any recurring or actively radarred source family that may be sent to
Scanning or Capture, specify a lake-first preflight before external acquisition:
inspect the relevant Silver/current view first, then packet or catalog inventory,
then raw material when necessary. Treat that inspection as reuse, freshness,
and coverage context only, not proof of current external reality. Absence from
Silver is not absence from the lake or the external world, and lack of a
relevant read model must not block acquisition.

For every evidence-like claim, distinguish:

- `provided`: supplied in the prompt or source pack;
- `source_backed`: supplied with a source citation, source date, or source path;
- `to_retrieve`: needed but not supplied;
- `gap`: expected signal/counterevidence missing or unavailable;
- `not_authorized`: source route would need authorization not present here;
- `not_applicable`: source route is not relevant to this commission.

For backtests, apply cutoff safety:

- include only observations (Observation) that would have been observable on or before
  `evidence_cutoff_at`;
- record source dates separately from access dates;
- mark any post-cutoff material as `excluded_future_info`;
- if cutoff observability cannot be determined, mark `cutoff_status: uncertain`
  and keep it out of classifier handoff except as a gap.

For backtests, separately check whether the source surface (Venue) itself existed or
was meaningfully observable by the cutoff. Do not mark a post-cutoff source
surface as ordinary `to_retrieve`. If the surface, tool, or answer-engine mode
did not exist by the cutoff, use `surface_cutoff_status: post_cutoff_surface`,
`evidence_status: excluded_future_info`, and
`cutoff_status: post_cutoff_excluded`. AEO / answer-engine surfaces are
especially cutoff-sensitive: for historical cutoffs before the relevant answer
surface existed, treat them as post-cutoff visibility only, not a normal
retrieval route.

## Commission Profile And Time-Posture Routing

Keep `mode: backtest | forward` unchanged. `commission_profile` and
`time_posture` are orthogonal controls.

- Default a one-company Brand or Org subject, including unresolved Brand/Org
  identity, to `company_competitive_intelligence`.
- Otherwise default to `standard_signal_board`.
- Standard uses the existing Sections 1-10 and classifier handoff below,
  unchanged.
- Company uses the conditional company Sections 1-10 below and omits
  classifier handoff.
- Keep one company at a time. Comparator pointers may interpret the subject;
  deep competitor treatment requires a separately named follow-up commission.

CSB owns profiles, source-family requirements, time posture, and typed
gaps/requests. Scanning owns intelligent-walk selection. Capture owns venue
access and preservation adapters. Emit requests to those lanes; do not execute
their runtimes.

## Time Posture

`recency_first` is the universal default:

| Age at `as_of_date` | `recency_tier` | Allowed primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-30 days | `days_0_30` | current-state anchor |
| 31-90 days | `days_31_90` | current corroboration |
| 91-180 days | `days_91_180` | context, or corroboration with rationale |
| >180 days | `days_over_180` | chronology/background only; never relabel current |

`longitudinal` is an explicit override only for change, recurrence, or
trajectory. It requires a declared start/end period and rationale. Evidence
inside that period may be primary for the longitudinal question, but its actual
date and tier remain visible and it is never relabeled current. A named event is
a route or query inside one of these two postures.

Do not label aligned signals observed across independent venues at one point in
time as `co-movement`: that is spatial alignment. `Co-movement` is a temporal
classification reserved for a future longitudinal product and requires at least
two observation dates; this contract does not emit it.

## Mini God Tier Target And Visible Limitations

Aim for mini god tier in the limited Forseti sense: most of the value of a heavier
signal-intelligence and graph-prep system, at prompt-first/manual-first speed.
This is a capability target only, not validation, readiness, proof, or scope
expansion.

Visible limitations to preserve in the output:

- not exhaustive web monitoring;
- not a standing source registry;
- not automated crawling or platform scraping authorization;
- not Discord scraping by default;
- not LinkedIn live access or relationship-graph analytics;
- not a graph database;
- not graph scoring;
- not a demand classifier;
- not buyer proof;
- not validation or readiness;
- not client-facing output.

## Source-Family Map

Preserve the hierarchy:

```text
source_family -> source_subfamily -> surface -> observable -> signal_role -> graph_role
```

Use this starting map. Add case-specific rows only when the commission context
requires them.

| Source family | Subfamilies / surfaces | Signal role / content | Capture posture |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Forums / community | Reddit; Quora; category-relevant generic or specialist forums discovered for the subject | external/customer language, comparisons, objections, corrections, and response context | Keep Reddit and Quora as explicit search-hygiene considerations. Commission external scouting only when the venue performs a named decision-material job and is not dominated by an equal-or-better included route; otherwise record the exclusion or `not_applicable` rationale. Zero yield is a route result, not completion. Discover other forums by category and hidden-venue cues, not a universal platform list. Community evidence is never representative demand or internal company fact. Execution stays with Scanning/Capture. |
| Reviews | retailer reviews, marketplace reviews, brand-site reviews, specialist fragrance reviews | experience claims, recency, complaints, repeat-use hints, contradiction checks | Do not collapse to aggregate stars. Preserve recency, source conventions, row-level incentive labels, corpus size, captured count, selection route, and truncation. |
| Creator / social video | Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, shorts/reels, affiliate/creator posts, later Reddit creator/community personalities | attention spread, creator clusters, campaign risk, audience language, propagation timing | Instagram has current adjacent capture/discovery work. TikTok, YouTube, and Reddit creator profiles are planned/deferred seams unless separately authorized. |
| Retail / PDP | Sephora, Ulta, Amazon, Nordstrom, brand PDPs, retailer search/category pages | availability, assortment, stock/discounting posture, review context, retailer corroboration | Retail/PDP is corroborative and operationally useful; it is not consumer-origin by itself. |
| Search / discovery | Google Trends, search-volume provider, SERP, preserved SERP packets, marketplace search, on-site search | interest traces, query language, discovery routes, hidden-venue pointers, counterevidence queries | Search-interest can carry attention/interest signal. Search-Surface MGT is a source-route scout only; methodology and pins stay with the answer-engine/search-interest source-family spec, while execution routes to Scanning frontier/exact-query work or Capture direct-source requests. |
| AEO / answer engines | Google AI Overviews, Gemini, ChatGPT, other answer-engine surfaces | answer visibility, cited-source ecosystem, entity association, visibility gaps | Visibility annotation only; never an independent demand-origin surface. Any change to this posture requires a Forseti owner decision, not a per-run dispatcher override. |
| News / editorial / trade | trade publications, editorial, newsletters, specialist blogs, press | launch chronology, industry framing, awareness, third-party narrative | News is a distinct family; LinkedIn reposts of news point back to the actual source. |
| Professional / org-motion | ATS/careers pages, hiring pages, founder/executive public posts, partnership announcements, LinkedIn when explicitly routed | hiring/movement, organizational intent, operator-side propagation | ATS/careers pages are better movement sources than LinkedIn. LinkedIn remains no-live/planning-only unless separately authorized. |
| Owned channels | brand site, brand socials, email archive, product pages, press releases | official chronology, brand claims, launch framing | High chronology value, low independence. |

Answer-engine/search-interest/AEO route note: for source-class or routing questions,
open `forseti/product/spines/scanning/README.md`, then
`forseti/product/spines/scanning/source_families/answer_engine/demand_search_interest_sourcing_and_gate_delta_spec_v0.md`,
then `docs/research/answer_engine/` as research/probe evidence only. Do not route
through legacy search-lane history, and do not treat AEO as product authority,
gate-recordable, validation/readiness/proof, capture authorization, scraping,
scaling, or implementation authorization.

### Search-Surface MGT Standing Route Card

Standing behavior: when a commission has an open question about market language,
comparison/confusion, hidden venues, or counterevidence queries, the board should
consider a Search-Surface MGT route row rather than leaving search discovery as
background prose.

Use this row pattern:

```yaml
source_family: search_discovery
source_subfamily: search_surface_mgt
signal_role: search_interest
row_purpose: source_route
evidence_status: provided | source_backed | to_retrieve | gap
```

CSB may point to preserved SERP packets as routing evidence, but it does not run
Google capture, score search demand, or treat query count, rank, repeated SERP
presence, PAA/PAS, product modules, or autocomplete as proof.

Preferred handoff:

```text
CSB source-route row
-> Scanning exact-query / frontier selection
-> Capture P1 direct-source acquisition when concrete URLs or surfaces exist
```

## Field Vocabulary

Use these fields consistently:

```yaml
source_family: forums_community | reviews | creator_social_video | retail_pdp | search_discovery | aeo_answer_engines | news_editorial_trade | professional_org_motion | owned_channels | other
source_subfamily:
surface:
observable:
capture_posture: available_now | planned_lane | deferred | manual_only | not_authorized | noisy_deferred
signal_role: consumer_language | review_experience | creator_attention | retail_corroboration | search_interest | aeo_visibility | org_motion | owned_claim | none
row_purpose: chronology | source_route | signal_unit | contradiction | gap | classifier_handoff | recency_priority
recency_status: current_state | recent | older_context | stale_or_unknown | not_applicable
recency_attention: high | normal | low | unknown
graph_role: seed | node_candidate | edge_candidate | propagation_path | campaign_overlap_check | counterevidence_path | none
graph_weight_hint: high | medium | low | none
evidence_status: provided | source_backed | to_retrieve | gap | not_authorized | not_applicable | excluded_future_info
cutoff_status: in_window | post_cutoff_excluded | uncertain | not_applicable
surface_cutoff_status: existed_by_cutoff | post_cutoff_surface | uncertain | not_applicable
```

`signal_role` records what kind of signal the source contributes.
`row_purpose` records why this row exists inside the board.
`recency_status` and `recency_attention` record source-route priority, not truth:
same-strength newer/current URL-backed signals normally deserve more downstream
scan attention than older sources, even when their direction differs.
`graph_role` records how the row helps retrieval or later graph organization.
`graph_weight_hint` is relation utility only. It is never signal strength.
`surface_cutoff_status` records whether a source surface was available within a
backtest cutoff, separately from whether a specific observation has evidence.

Board labels are board-local. They do not map one-to-one onto demand-classifier
families. In particular, `org_motion` here means professional / hiring /
partnership movement, while retail presence belongs under Retail / PDP. The
demand classifier owns any board-`signal_role` to classifier-family mapping.

## Signal Collection Allocation

Use effort allocation as search hygiene, not a gate rule:

- majority effort: independent origin/experience/attention/corroboration routes;
- elevated effort: current or recent URL-backed source states when same-strength
  older sources would otherwise steer the board;
- meaningful effort: counterevidence, contradictions, campaign-overlap risk,
  and missing-signal checks;
- smaller effort: owned chronology and official claims.

Do not express allocation as pass/fail thresholds. If a source family is absent,
record it as a gap or not-applicable route. No numeric source, row, observation,
venue, capture-target, or effort target establishes inclusion or completion.
Include an item only when `Why check it`, `Row purpose`, or `Handoff note`
names the decision-material job it performs and no equal-or-better included item
performs the same job.

## Graph-Light Contract

The board owns only the graph retrieval brief and graph-ready row labels.

The board may define:

- seed entities;
- adjacent products (Product), brands (Brand), formats, scent families, claims, or categories to
  check;
- creator slices and planned/deferred creator surfaces;
- source families and subfamilies to retrieve;
- mandatory counterevidence paths;
- node types to retrieve;
- edge types to retrieve;
- campaign-overlap and duplication checks;
- cutoff-date rule for backtests;
- graph-ready signal rows.

The board does not own:

- graph construction;
- graph database or persistent graph infrastructure;
- graph scoring;
- centrality or clustering algorithms;
- evidence weighting;
- demand classification;
- forecast probabilities;
- judgment or recommendation.

## Output Contract

Return the board in this exact section order. Use concise Markdown plus YAML
blocks where specified.

### 1. Commission Intake Receipt

```yaml
commission_id:
mode:
candidate_or_subject:
decision_context:
market_or_geography:
time_window:
evidence_cutoff_at:
input_status: complete | blocked | partial
missing_required_inputs:
cutoff_rule:
non_goals_preserved:
```

### 2. Boundary Statement

One short paragraph stating that this is an evidence/signals-only board, not a
demand verdict, proof claim, graph artifact, forecast, judgment, or client
output.

### 3. Source-Family Coverage Plan

Markdown table:

`Source family | Subfamily / surface | Capture posture | Why check it | Expected observable | Evidence status | Surface cutoff status | Cutoff status | Notes`

Include all relevant families. Include non-relevant families only when their
absence is decision-relevant.

For each included route, `Why check it` must name how the route could change the
action, action ceiling, rival assessment, or hold condition. If an equal-or-
better included route performs the same job, omit the route or record it as a
dominated exclusion rather than an acquisition target.

When the commission has unresolved market-language,
comparison/confusion, hidden-venue, or counterevidence-query questions, include
`search_discovery / search_surface_mgt` in this plan even if no SERP packet exists
yet; mark evidence status `to_retrieve` or `gap`.

### 4. Signal Board Rows

Markdown table:

`Row ID | Source family | Subfamily | Surface | Observable | Signal role | Row purpose | Recency status | Recency attention | Graph role | Graph weight hint | Evidence status | Provenance needed | Surface cutoff status | Cutoff status | Handoff note`

Rules:

- Use stable row IDs: `SBR-001`, `SBR-002`, etc.
- When the Search-Surface MGT standing route card is triggered, include a route
  row rather than only prose. Use source family `search_discovery`, subfamily
  `search_surface_mgt`, signal role `search_interest`, and row purpose
  `source_route`. Use `Handoff note` to route Scanning exact-query/frontier
  work or Capture P1 direct-source acquisition. Do not list such rows in
  classifier handoff unless later retrieval produces source-backed, eligible
  evidence under Section 8.
- Do not combine distinct subfamilies in one row when their access,
  provenance, noise, or graph behavior differs.
- Mark unsupported rows as `to_retrieve` or `gap`; do not make evidence claims.
- For backtests, set `surface_cutoff_status` before assigning `evidence_status`.
  Post-cutoff surfaces are `excluded_future_info`, not ordinary `to_retrieve`.
- Counterevidence rows are first-class rows, not footnotes.
- `Row purpose` plus `Handoff note` must name the row's decision-material job.
  Omit substitutable rows when an equal-or-better included row performs that job;
  a dominance/exclusion note is not evidence inclusion or completion credit.
- Use `recency_attention: high` for same-strength newer/current signals that
  should receive more downstream scan attention than older context; this does
  not make the row proof, demand classification, or graph weight.
- Use `row_purpose: recency_priority` only when the row exists primarily to flag
  a recency routing priority; ordinary signal rows that happen to be recent can
  stay `signal_unit` with `recency_attention: high`.

### 5. Mandatory Counterevidence Paths

Markdown table:

`Path ID | What could disconfirm or weaken the signal | Source families to check | Why it matters | Evidence status | Cutoff rule`

Consider these only when they perform a named decision-material job:

- creator-only or affiliate-campaign concentration;
- retailer/review contradiction;
- forum/community rejection or lack of uptake;
- search-interest decay or absence;
- owned-channel-only chronology;
- AEO visibility without origin signal;
- post-cutoff contamination in backtests.

### 6. Campaign And Duplication Risk

Markdown table:

`Risk ID | Possible duplication/campaign pattern | Surfaces implicated | Required check | Evidence status | Handoff note`

Treat creator clusters, PR launches, affiliate links, identical phrasing,
retailer/brand syndication, and answer-engine/cited-source loops as duplication
risks to check. Do not conclude manipulation unless supplied evidence supports
that claim.

### 7. Graph Retrieval Brief

Use `graph_weight_notes` to record relation utility only (connection richness, propagation clustering, duplication risk, counterevidence routing). Do not record signal strength or demand-origin confidence here; graph weight is never signal weight.

Use `forecast_targets_supported_without_probabilities` only to name downstream
outcomes this evidence could help forecast later, such as review velocity,
restock/stockout, discounting, creator decay, search decay, or retailer
assortment changes. Do not assign probabilities.

### 8. Demand-Classifier Handoff Packet

```yaml
classifier_handoff_packet:
  candidate_or_subject:
  decision_context:
  mode:
  cutoff_date:
  signal_rows_for_handoff:
  counterevidence_rows_for_handoff:
  source_family_gaps:
  provenance_gaps:
  cutoff_uncertainties:
  durability_projection_evidence_or_gap:
  decay_lifespan_evidence_or_gap:
  manufactured_hype_dedup_risk:
  classifier_mapping_status: classifier_owned
  prohibited_claims:
    - no demand verdict
    - no buyer-proof claim
    - no validation or readiness claim
    - no graph score
    - no forecast probability
```

The classifier handoff packet is a packaging surface only. It may carry evidence
or gaps relevant to a later durability projection, decay-lifespan read, or
manufactured-hype dedupe risk, but it does not call those states. Do not map rows
to classifier families unless the dispatcher provides the classifier mapping.

For backtests: include rows in `signal_rows_for_handoff` or
`counterevidence_rows_for_handoff` only after retrieval proves
`cutoff_status: in_window`. Exclude rows where
`surface_cutoff_status: post_cutoff_surface`,
`surface_cutoff_status: uncertain`, `cutoff_status: post_cutoff_excluded`,
`cutoff_status: uncertain`, or `evidence_status: excluded_future_info`. Carry
excluded or cutoff-uncertain rows to `source_family_gaps` and/or
`cutoff_uncertainties` instead, with a note explaining whether the surface was
post-cutoff or cutoff observability is not yet proven.

### 9. Visible Limitations

List limitations specific to this commission. Include platform, source access,
cutoff, provenance, graph, classifier, and non-claim limitations.

### 10. Board Status And Run Boundary

Return this YAML block:

```yaml
board_status: READY_FOR_RETRIEVAL_HANDOFF | COLLECTION_BOARD_ONLY | NEEDS_COMMISSION_INTAKE | NEEDS_CUTOFF_DATE | NEEDS_OWNER_DECISION
run_boundary: CHAT_ONLY_BOARD_COMPLETE | INTAKE_ONLY | OWNER_DECISION_NEEDED
next_authorized_step: <one sentence>
```

Use `board_status` for the board's usefulness:

- `READY_FOR_RETRIEVAL_HANDOFF` - the board is complete enough to hand to a
  separately authorized retrieval/extraction lane. This is CSB planning
  completeness only: it is not acquisition closure, a frozen participant
  packet, a demand verdict, or demand-classification readiness signal; any
  classifier use remains separately authorized under the demand classifier's
  own authority.
- `COLLECTION_BOARD_ONLY` - the board is useful as a collection map, but major
  gaps or cutoff uncertainties prevent a clean retrieval handoff.
- `NEEDS_COMMISSION_INTAKE` - required intake fields are missing; return the
  intake scaffold instead of a board.
- `NEEDS_CUTOFF_DATE` - backtest mode lacks a cutoff date; return the intake
  scaffold instead of a board.
- `NEEDS_OWNER_DECISION` - source access, source posture, classifier mapping,
  or graph boundary requires owner choice before retrieval.

Use `run_boundary` for what happened in this invocation:

- `CHAT_ONLY_BOARD_COMPLETE` - useful board returned in chat, with no file
  write or downstream execution authorized.
- `INTAKE_ONLY` - only the intake scaffold was returned.
- `OWNER_DECISION_NEEDED` - the next move requires owner choice before the board
  can be used.

If more than one applies, choose the most limiting status and explain the others
in one sentence.

## Conditional Company Competitive-Intelligence Output Contract

Use this contract only when
`commission_profile: company_competitive_intelligence`. Do not reuse the
standard classifier handoff. Sections 1, 3, 4, 9, and 10 require the typed YAML
documents below. Sections 2 and 5-8 are concise narrative sections that cite
the applicable `OBS-NNN` rows and preserve their named boundaries.

Admission principle for synthesis: an observation earns narrative placement
when it strengthens a linked commercial claim — a stated connection between
evidence and a consequence-bearing statement — not merely because it covers a
lens. Ledger completeness rules are unchanged; this governs what the narrative
foregrounds. Route research priorities retail, customer, and claims first,
subject to the named-job and substitution rules; this is an attention order,
not a quota or proof hierarchy. Readability: Sections 5-8 open with
plain-language lead sentences before citation density and include both the
SKU/item-reception and known/inferred/unknown matrices as plain Markdown tables,
using explicit gap or unknown cells where evidence is absent. The typed ledgers
remain the audit floor behind the narrative, never the front door.

When offerings, retail presentation, or customer experience are material to a
company commission, acquire breadth before product depth. First establish the
owned portfolio architecture (public shop-all/bestseller surfaces,
collections or franchises, parent products, and visible variants), then the
brand/assortment grid at one primary retailer, and reconcile both into a
franchise -> parent product -> variant/SKU -> retailer-listing map. Only then
select up to three representative franchises for PDP and customer-evidence
deepening: the evidence-supported dominant franchise; the founding or otherwise
strategically central franchise; and, only when materially distinct, one
contrasting extension or plausible weak link. Fewer than three is valid; do not
pad the set or presuppose hero status.

Choose the primary retailer from subject authorization, target-market
relevance, assortment breadth, structured evidence depth, and route
admissibility. When the subject has a material retailer presence and the bound
question depends on retail expression, that primary-retailer row is required.
At most one secondary retailer is conditional on a named, non-duplicative
channel, assortment, price, availability, authenticity, or customer-evidence
job. A tertiary retailer is exception-only to resolve a material contradiction
or gap. Use the existing coverage-ledger `requirement`, `relevance_rationale`,
and typed-gap fields; retailer role adds no new schema, quota, or completion
credit. Retailer evidence remains retailer evidence, not authority for internal
company fact.

### Executive Intelligence Brief (completed reports only)

A completed company report (`run_boundary:
COMPANY_REPORT_COMPLETE_NO_DOWNSTREAM_EXECUTION`) opens with an
`## Executive Intelligence Brief` preamble before Section 1 — the
decision-facing layer over the audit spine. Commission-stage boards
(`COMMISSION_SEALED_PRE_SCAN`) omit it: no earned conclusions exist yet.
The brief contains:

- Three to seven front-page conclusions, each in the five-field form:
  claim / evidence bound / commercial consequence / confidence / next
  observable. State commercial consequence with maximum decisive directness
  and state confidence plainly at the strongest level the evidence and
  uncertainty support. This authorizes aggressive clarity, not stronger
  evidence or higher confidence: the evidence bound and next observable make
  the statement auditable. Two guards keep that directness honest, written in
  plain analyst prose rather than stacked qualifiers: an inference stays
  worded as an inference even at full directness — "the storefront is most
  plausibly brand-operated" is fully decisive without claiming the
  observation — and a small or uncorroborated sample supports existence
  ("substantive complaints exist and attack the claim"), never
  concentration, rates, or comparatives, unless a comparator base is cited.
  Never inflate evidence, certainty, or
  representativeness, and keep the report
  decision-aware-neutral: consequence names which decisions the conclusion
  could inform, never pain, priority, buyer, or wedge assignment.
- One chain card per evidence-selected representative franchise where the
  evidence supports it, using one representative parent product for the
  customer-evidence chain: five cited lines — the claim; observed buy motivation
  within the cited customer-world sample (not willingness-to-pay or
  representative demand); observed experience; the complaint that attacks the
  claim; and the bounded substitute customers cite or compare when the claim
  breaks (not a defection or demand-capture claim). A card compresses to one
  front-page conclusion row. Present at most three such rows, and fewer when the
  reconciled portfolio does not support three materially distinct franchises.
- The central-promise voice and internal adjudication frame: where observable
  value resides; what drives it; whether the evidence shows it strengthening,
  weakening, or not proven; and what threatens it — each statement carrying
  its invalidation condition. This frame organizes conclusions; it does not
  replace decision adjudication as the product center.

```

### 2. Decision-Neutral Boundary

State the permitted decision-neutral lenses and explicitly preserve these
boundaries: one company at a time; deep competitor treatment requires a
separately named follow-up; no pain, buyer, ICP, priority, urgency, willingness
to pay, outreach, offer, or wedge conclusion.

### 3. Source-Family And Venue Coverage Ledger

```yaml
coverage_ledger:
  - coverage_id: COV-001
    source_family: forums_community | reviews | creator_social_video | retail_pdp | search_discovery | aeo_answer_engines | news_editorial_trade | professional_org_motion | owned_channels | other
    source_surface:

    route_or_query:
    requirement: required | mandatory_bounded_scout | experimental_initial_proving_run | category_aware | conditional
    status: checked | blocked | not_applicable | not_checked
    yield: evidence_found | zero_yield | blocked | unknown | not_applicable
    recency:
    access:
    relevance:
    gap_id: GAP-001 | null
```

Every company report records the Reddit consideration row for compatibility and
search-hygiene accountability; initial proving runs do the same for Quora. These
rows may record `not_applicable` or non-selection when no named decision-material
job survives the substitution test. External scouting is requested only for a
non-dominated job. Zero yield is a route result, not completion. Other forum
discovery is category-aware. A blocked or missing row needs a typed gap/request;
`not_applicable` needs a rationale.

When retail is material, use separate coverage rows for the owned architecture,
the primary retailer, and any conditional secondary or exception-only tertiary
retailer. State each retailer's role and distinct information job in
`relevance_rationale`; do not make secondary or tertiary coverage mandatory by
count. A conditional retailer becomes load-bearing only when acquired evidence
promotes its named job into a material seam under the acquisition playbook.

### 4. Observation Ledger

```yaml
observation_ledger:
  - observation_id: OBS-001
    subject_name:
    subject_kind: brand | org | brand_or_org_unresolved

    current_state_use: primary_current | current_corroboration | supporting_or_recurrence | chronology_historical_baseline | contradiction | longitudinal_primary | not_applicable
    consumed_by_sections: [5]
```

A current page does not date every claim or event on it. Syndicated copies are
one origin, not independent corroboration. Community rows use
`fact_domain: external_customer_evidence` and cannot establish representative
demand or internal company fact.

### 5. Positioning, Offerings, Markets, And Channels

Summarize observable positioning, offerings/claims, markets, and channels.
Cite the supporting observation IDs and name contradictions and evidence gaps.
Where the substrate supports it, state publicly visible concentration — which
franchises, retailers, and surfaces observable value concentrates in — always
as visible concentration, never revenue concentration, share, or dependence
claims.

### 6. Strategic And Operating Chronology

Summarize strategic and operating chronology with observation IDs. Under
`longitudinal`, name the bounded change, recurrence, or trajectory; otherwise
do not manufacture one. Preserve evidence gaps. For each material
interpretation this section carries, state what observable evidence would
invalidate it.

### 7. Customer And Community Response

Summarize customer and community response with observation IDs. State that the
evidence is not representative demand and not internal company fact. Preserve
contradictions and evidence gaps.

When a retailer-review corpus is decision-material, row-level ratings and
source-visible incentive posture are captured, and the corpus boundary is
reproducible, the parent observation may carry this optional derived block.
Omit it rather than reconstructing counts from a headline rating or an
unreproducible sample:

```yaml
retailer_review_approval_signal:
  corpus_basis: complete_visible_corpus | reproducible_bounded_sample
  source_visible_total: <integer> | unknown
  captured_total:
  sample_selection: <sort, window/filter, and row-admission basis>
  incentive_disclosure_basis: <source-visible flags or exact labels used>
  excluded_explicit_incentivized:
  excluded_unknown_or_conflicting:
  excluded_other:
  excluded_other_reason: <required when excluded_other > 0> | none
  eligible_explicit_non_incentivized:
  eligible_not_marked_incentivized:
  eligible_total:
  eligible_positive_4_5:
  eligible_below_positive_1_3:
  approval_rate_pct:
  below_positive_rate_pct:
  explicit_non_incentivized_sensitivity:  # optional; only when the source explicitly labels this state
    eligible_total:
    positive_4_5:
    below_positive_1_3:
    approval_rate_pct:
    below_positive_rate_pct:
```

Preserve all captured rows in the source packet; exclusion applies only to the
derived primary view. The primary label is `approval among reviews not marked
incentivized`, never `organic approval`. Four- and five-star rows are positive;
one-, two-, and three-star rows are below-positive. Always state the eligible
denominator, excluded-incentivized count, source, capture date, and corpus
basis. Express `approval_rate_pct` and `below_positive_rate_pct` to one decimal
using round-half-up. A bounded sample must be labeled as that sample, not the
retailer-wide corpus. The explicit-non-incentivized sensitivity is a separate
view, never silently substituted for the primary denominator.

This signal describes only the captured retailer-review corpus. It establishes
neither representative demand, market consensus, prevalence beyond its defined
corpus, causal incentive distortion, nor a comparison without a comparable
method and denominator.

Retailer product attributes and reviewer attributes are different evidence
classes. Label retailer-authored suitability or taxonomy as retailer metadata;
label age, skin type, skin concern, or similar review fields as reviewer
self-report when that is their source. Summarize a reviewer-attribute
distribution only with the captured-corpus denominator, the attribute-reporting
denominator, missingness or coverage, selection/filter basis, and visible
incentive posture. A large reporting subgroup may make that subgroup estimate
precise; it does not make the subgroup representative of all reviewers,
purchasers, or customers. Cross-product comparisons require comparable capture
methods and missingness boundaries.

For each evidence-selected representative franchise, add at most one
choice-mechanism chain card using one representative parent product: claim ->
why customers buy -> what they experience -> which complaints attack the claim
-> where defectors go, every link citing observation IDs. Select no more than
three franchises after owned and primary-retailer portfolio reconciliation;
normally cover the dominant franchise, the founding or strategically central
franchise, and one materially distinct contrasting extension or plausible weak
link. Do not call a franchise a hero until owned prominence and independent
retailer/customer evidence support that conclusion. Feed each link only from
sources that can observe it; no route observes population rates, switching
volume, or sell-through, so no cell may state one. Buy-reason carries reported
motivation and positioned draws, never measured demand; substitutes are cited
alternatives and price gaps, never switching.

When substantive review text has been sampled, record each classified review
as one row in this block (the only durable structure this section adds), and
otherwise omit the block rather than inventing rows:

```yaml
review_classification_rows:
  - parent_observation_id: OBS-NNN  # the review-sampling observation row; venue, access route, observation date, and independence lineage live there
    product:
    star:
    class: substantiation_risk | core_positioning_threat | price_value | education_gap | ordinary_defect | held_background
    claim_attacked: <claim token> | none
    specificity: vague | mechanism_or_ingredient_specific
    date: YYYY-MM-DD | null  # the review's own publication date as the surface shows it
```

Chain rules (conclusion-writing guidance; no other durable structure):

- Admission: where the surface exposes a verified-purchase marker, only
  marker-bearing reviews with non-trivial body text are classified; where it
  does not, non-trivial body text alone admits. Contentless star ratings stay
  in aggregate rating observations and are never classified.
- Classify relative to the brand's stated load-bearing claim set, stated
  first. `substantiation_risk` names a specific stated claim plus a specific
  checkable counter; `core_positioning_threat` reports the harm the
  load-bearing positioning promises to prevent and clears the graduation bar;
  `price_value` makes worth, price, or a cheaper equivalent the grievance;
  `education_gap` is an expectation or use mismatch where the product
  performed as designed and never claimed otherwise; `ordinary_defect` is the
  residual performance or quality failure unrelated to a load-bearing claim.
- Reaction complaints default to `held_background` — counted in the stated
  sample and named as category background, never a claim-attack. A held
  complaint graduates only when it is ingredient-specific, repeated across
  independent venues, or directly attacks a stated load-bearing claim; an
  ingredient-specific complaint attacking no stated claim never graduates.
  Tie-break precedence for the primary class: substantiation_risk >
  core_positioning_threat > price_value > education_gap > ordinary_defect.
  Rows carry the primary class only; a secondary reading that changes the
  read is carried by the narrative citing the row.
- Proportions are of stated samples only: `<n> of <N> sampled substantive
  <negative | all> reviews — <venue>, <date range>, <selection route and
  admission handling>`, stated so a second scanner could reproduce `N`.
  Never a population rate. With no sample, state the named instances and the
  next observable instead. State once, adapting the category wording:
  *Sensitive-skin cosmetics accrue idiosyncratic-reaction complaints as
  category background; this card tracks no comparator base rate and makes no
  cross-brand rate claim.*
- Amplification is a property of the attacked claim, never of volume: an
  explicit and specific claim (named label word, ingredient-level, or seal)
  amplifies High; explicit but general amplifies Medium; no stated claim
  means no claim-attack amplification (the complaint keeps its class).
  Amplification raises decision weight, never the stated number, and appears
  beside the denominator or its stated absence.
- Card shape: one mechanism sentence whose every load-bearing noun traces to
  a cited cell; five cells (claim / buy-reason / experience / complaint
  class / substitute), each carrying its observation IDs, what each ID shows
  — staying inside that row's excerpt, time anchor, fact domain, and
  ambiguity limitation — and a confidence mark (verified / corroborated /
  proxy / thin / unverified; a cell takes the weakest load-bearing input;
  the complaint cell may split existence vs prevalence, using `unsampled` for
  the prevalence side when no denominator exists). A link with no substantive
  evidence states so with its gap or request ID. Cells whose evidence could
  change a conclusion, be disputed, or disappear emit the existing
  capture-request trigger.
- Compress each card to one 5-field conclusion row — claim / evidence /
  consequence / confidence / next observable — with maximum aggressiveness
  in consequence and confidence, made safe by the evidence bound and the
  next observable, never by evidence overclaim. Conclusion rows feed the
  Executive Intelligence Brief preamble.

### 8. Competitor Context, Contradictions, And Gaps

Use bounded comparator pointers only where they interpret the subject. Cite
observation IDs, contradictions, and gaps. State that deep competitor treatment
requires a separately named follow-up commission. Collect defensibility raw
material where visible — comparator claims language, substitution economics,
price gaps, claims parity — as bounded observations only; the defensibility
judgment itself belongs to the downstream adjudication layer, never this
report. Understanding collects that generic raw material once. Problem Framing
may request fresh evidence only as a decision-specific supplement for the
decision it is adjudicating, never as a general re-scan.

### 9. Company Surface Candidate Ledger

CSB planning completeness is coverage of every required lens plus explicit
typed gaps, exclusions, and requests. It is not acquisition closure or final
packet inclusion, and no length, page, source-count, observation, venue, or
capture-target number establishes it. Scanning owns marginal acquisition,
dominance, and acquisition closure. In lens coverage, `complete` means covered
for the commissioned purpose with typed gaps — never exhaustive; when coverage
is materially partial, the lens rationale names its decisive gap ids.

Preservation trigger for requests: route a Capture request when an observation
is conclusion-bearing, disputable, or likely to disappear, naming which
conclusion depends on it; negative/absence observations need route, date, and
query only, never capture. Fulfillment mechanics (single-file capture,
compression, receipts) are Capture-owned.

Commission-stage rule: a company board sealed **before** its scan executes uses
`run_boundary: COMMISSION_SEALED_PRE_SCAN`. That boundary is valid only while
the coverage ledger still contains `status: not_checked` rows (the commissioned
scan routes). At that stage `reddit_scout_status` and `quora_scout_status` may
use `commissioned_not_yet_run`; those values are invalid under any other run
boundary, and a completed company report must replace them with the earned
checked/blocked values. `COMPANY_REPORT_COMPLETE_NO_DOWNSTREAM_EXECUTION`
remains the completed-report boundary; it may still carry `not_checked` rows
only as explicitly typed gaps.

In every stage, each scout status must match its corresponding coverage row:
positive yield means `status: checked` plus `yield: evidence_found`; zero yield
means `status: checked` plus `yield: zero_yield`; blocked means
`status: blocked` plus `yield: blocked`; `commissioned_not_yet_run` means
`status: not_checked` plus `yield: unknown`; and
`not_required_no_decision_material_job` (either venue) means no row for that
venue, or a non-selection row recorded as `not_applicable` / `not_applicable`.

## Final Rules

- Use the selected profile's ten-section contract only.
- Do not impose report-length, source-count, page, or observation caps; remove
  duplication and ornament, not necessary completeness.
- Do not freeze a participant packet or declare acquisition complete. CSB names
  material information jobs and candidate routes; Scanning owns dominance and
  value-based acquisition closure.
- Prefer explicit gaps over invented completeness.
- Preserve source family and subfamily identity.
- Treat AEO as visibility annotation only.
- For backtests, treat post-cutoff source surfaces as `excluded_future_info`
  rather than normal retrieval routes.
- Treat Discord as noisy_deferred unless public, repeatable, bounded, and
  noise-controlled.
- Treat LinkedIn as no-live/planning-only unless explicitly routed; prefer
  ATS/careers pages for movement.
- Treat creator surfaces as graph-rich but never demand proof by themselves.
- Keep graph weight separate from signal weight.
- Keep recency attention separate from proof, classifier mapping, and graph
  weight; it routes attention, not truth.
- Apply the Search-Surface MGT standing route card whenever its trigger is
  relevant; route execution to Scanning/Capture, never to CSB-owned search
  capture, and never count SERP rank, query count, module recurrence, or
  autocomplete as demand proof.
- If this is a repo-aware run that produced a full output, run the local
  validator before making a mechanical-completeness claim. Standard boards may
  proceed to classifier handoff only under their existing contract; company
  reports never emit one. Do not validate intake-only output.
- End with the selected profile's Section 10 YAML block.

    The company competitive-intelligence contract's Section 7 gains the
    choice-mechanism chain: a per-hero chain card (claim -> buy-reason ->

    claims-to-complaints classification with held_background default and
    graduation triggers, stated-sample-only proportionality with a

    The company competitive-intelligence contract gains its synthesis layer as
    guidance-only text (no schema, ledger, or validator-field changes):
    completed reports open with an Executive Intelligence Brief preamble
    (three to seven five-field conclusions at maximum decisive strength inside
    the decision-neutral boundary, chain cards, central-promise voice with
    invalidation conditions); Section 5 states publicly visible concentration;
    Section 6 states invalidation signals; Section 7 builds the
    customer-choice mechanism chain with the five-way complaint classification
    and stated-sample proportionality rules; Section 8 primes defensibility
    raw material without judgment; the linked-commercial-claim admission
    principle and plain-language readability govern narrative foregrounding;
    lens-status `complete` is defined as covered-for-purpose-with-typed-gaps;
    a preservation trigger governs when observations route Capture requests.
    Origin: the externally-assessed Tower 28 round adjudicated in
    docs/decisions/forseti_ci_report_external_review_adjudication_ledger_v0.md
    (owner rulings 2026-07-17). The chain design handoff lane may refine the
    Section 7 mechanics; its return is adjudicated against the same ledger.

## Non-Claims

This prompt does not:

- ratify the Commission Signal Board as final product doctrine;
- authorize retrieval, scraping, crawling, source capture, or platform access;
- authorize graph construction, graph storage, graph scoring, or graph runtime;
- authorize demand classification, evidence weighting, forecasting, judgment,
  buyer proof, validation, readiness, or client-facing use;
- authorize file writes unless a later wrapper or dispatcher instruction binds
  a target path and docs-write permission.

## Next Authorized Step

Run one manual dry backtest or forward-case prompt invocation in chat-only mode.
If that output is useful, commission an adversarial artifact review of this
prompt or author a thin wrapper that binds a durable board output path for the
first controlled run.
