"""Daemon-ready runner: derive Fragrantica Cleaning output for every committed packet.

The seam-shaped CATCH-UP entrypoint for the Fragrantica Cleaning lane. Until now the
audit pack + post-cleaned Silver records were written only when an operator pointed
``cleaning.fragrantica_lake.derive_fragrantica_cleaning_into_lake`` at one packet: the
lane had NO discovery, so a packet nobody pointed at never got its Cleaning records.
This runner independently scans committed availability and derives for every packet
whose current obligation is not yet acknowledged.

Pickup is the consumption seam (``data_lake.consumption``). The obligation snapshot is
policy-only: the raw packet is immutable (write-once), the Fragrantica projection is
rebuilt in memory from raw bodies (the committed ``projection_fragrantica`` records are
NOT consumed), and the cleaning packet's ECR ref is symbolic-by-convention (no committed
ECR content is read) — so the derivation has no growable derived-record inputs, and the
pre-existing policy constants (cleaning core, projection version, producer schema
versions) are the lane's only re-trigger inputs. Skip-if-done keys on the ACK: this
lane writes no record-set completion marker (audit + Silver are independent appends
with fresh ULIDs), so an unacknowledged fingerprint always derives a FRESH audit
sibling + fresh Silver records and the ack cites them; a crash mid-derivation leaves
unreferenced siblings and NO ack, so the packet re-surfaces and re-derives cleanly.
Contract: ``core_spine_v0_data_lake_consumption_seam_contract_v0.md``.

SURFACE GATE: the ``fragrance_native_database`` family is shared with the basenotes and
parfumo cleaning lanes, split by ``source_surface``. A picked-up packet whose committed
availability entry carries a non-Fragrantica surface has no Fragrantica-cleanable
content — the discovery outcome IS the completion evidence (the IG runner's
grid-packet precedent), and a surface is immutable, so the packet is acknowledged with
explicit out-of-scope evidence rather than re-surfacing forever or being handed to the
wrong deriver. Those packets remain fully available to their own lanes' namespaces.

Failure stays loud and isolated per packet: a missing availability entry is a
``discovery_failed`` status; a verified-read/validation/derivation raise is a
``derive_failed`` status; both leave the packet unacknowledged and re-surfacing every
run. An ack write failure surfaces as ``ack_failed``. Acked-and-unchanged packets emit
NO per-run status entries. Per-packet availability reconcile failures surface as
``availability_reconcile_failed`` (the F-ECR-001 adjudicated shape) while healthy
packets still index and process.

No-LLM zone (`runners/`): the Cleaning derivation is mechanical (projection rebuild +
transform ledger) — this runner needs no transport, so ``--run`` IS the cadence
entrypoint.
