"""Daemon-ready runner: project every committed IG reels-grid packet into its Silver record.

The seam-shaped CATCH-UP entrypoint for the IG reels-grid projection lane. The lane's
committed records have a REAL downstream consumer — the creator-profile spine's
``instagram_metric_seed`` walks ``derived/<pkt>/projection_ig_reels_grid/`` to build
creator metric seeds — so a committed grid packet without its projection record is
invisible to creator metrics. Until now the lane had two entrypoints, neither on the
seam: the operator-pointed ``project_ig_reels_grid_into_lake`` (no discovery) and the
Bronze-catalog proof path ``project_ig_reels_grid_from_bronze_catalog`` (discovers via
the generated catalog, skip-if-done keyed on RECORD EXISTENCE — so a projection policy
bump would never re-derive; that path remains the catalog plumbing proof, not the
cadence entrypoint). This runner independently scans committed availability and
derives for every packet whose current obligation is not yet acknowledged.

Pickup is the consumption seam (``data_lake.consumption``). The obligation snapshot is
policy-only: the raw packet is immutable (write-once), the projection is a pure
function of raw bytes + policy (no date-relative selection — the capture file's
``selection_policy_version`` is per-packet raw data carried in the output, not a
policy input), and no committed derived record is consumed. Skip-if-done keys on the
ACK: each derivation appends a fresh ULID sibling and the ack cites it; a crash
mid-derivation leaves an unreferenced sibling and NO ack, so the packet re-surfaces
and re-derives cleanly. Contract: ``core_spine_v0_data_lake_consumption_seam_contract_v0.md``.

SURFACE GATE: the ``instagram_creator`` family is shared with the transcript/ASR,
deep-capture, and calls lanes, split by ``source_surface``. A picked-up packet whose
committed availability entry carries a known non-grid surface has no grid-projectable
content — the discovery outcome IS the completion evidence (cleaning-family
precedent), and a surface is immutable, so the packet is acknowledged with explicit
out-of-scope evidence rather than re-surfacing forever. Those packets remain fully
available to their own lanes' namespaces. Unknown family surfaces stay visible and
UNACKED as ``unsupported_surface`` (no open-world acks).

Failure stays loud and isolated per packet: a missing availability entry is a
``discovery_failed`` status; a verified-read/validation/projection raise is a
``derive_failed`` status; both leave the packet unacknowledged and re-surfacing every
run. An ack write failure surfaces as ``ack_failed``. Acked-and-unchanged packets emit
NO per-run status entries. Availability reconcile is the shared per-packet
fail-visible helper (``data_lake.consumption.reconcile_availability_per_packet``).

No-LLM zone (`runners/`): the projection is mechanical (JSON decode + row carry) —
this runner needs no transport, so ``--run`` IS the cadence entrypoint.
