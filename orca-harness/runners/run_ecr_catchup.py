"""Daemon-ready runner: derive source-side ECR postures for every committed packet.

The seam-shaped CATCH-UP entrypoint for the ECR lane. Until now ECR record sets were
written only when an operator pointed ``ecr.lake.derive_ecr_into_lake`` at one packet
(smoke runner / pilot flows): the lane had NO discovery, so a packet nobody pointed at
never got its ECR records. This runner independently scans committed availability and
derives the four-posture sibling set for every packet whose current obligation is not
yet acknowledged.

Pickup is the consumption seam (``data_lake.consumption``): the obligation snapshot is
{schema, consumer, deriver_version} ONLY — the raw packet is immutable (write-once), the
derivers are pure over its manifest, and ECR consumes no growable derived records, so
the deriver policy token is the lane's only re-trigger input. A committed packet is
therefore picked up exactly once per policy version. Skip-if-done keys on the ACK, not
on existing ``ecr_set`` markers: a pre-seam sibling set carries no deriver-version
attribution, so an unacknowledged fingerprint always derives a FRESH sibling set
(append-only re-derive is the lane's documented semantic) and the ack cites that set.
Consequence, stated: the first catch-up run over a lake holding pre-seam ECR sets
re-derives those packets once — benign sibling duplication, never an overwrite.
Contract: ``core_spine_v0_data_lake_consumption_seam_contract_v0.md``.

Failure stays loud and isolated per packet: a packet whose verified read, manifest
validation, or derivation raises yields a ``derive_failed`` status, is never
acknowledged, and re-surfaces every run. An ack write failure surfaces as
``ack_failed``. Acked-and-unchanged packets emit NO per-run status entries; the
durable ack records under ``acknowledgements/`` are the completion facts.

No-LLM zone (`runners/`): the ECR derivers are pure functions over the packet
manifest — this runner needs no transport, so ``--run`` IS the cadence entrypoint.
