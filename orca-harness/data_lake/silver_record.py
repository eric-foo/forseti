"""Silver Vault record envelope validation + the validating write front-door.

The no-blur invariant the Silver layer depends on -- a closed ``record_kind``, the
evidence-vs-fact split (a Silver observation is a FACT, never the Cleaning transform
ledger), and the MetricObservation posture coupling -- is enforced here as CODE, not
convention. ``append_silver_record`` is the validating front-door: a producer that
routes a Silver record through it cannot persist a blurred one, because validation
raises before any bytes are written.

Scope (v0): the record ENVELOPE invariants only (``record_kind`` / ``payload_kind`` /
no-ledger-in-observation / MetricObservation posture). The lineage-block shape
(``raw_refs``/``derived_refs`` vs the ``silver_lineage`` kit) is a separate, deferred
reconciliation -- this validator does not re-shape a producer's lineage. The generic
``data_lake.root.append_record`` stays payload-blind; this is a Silver-aware layer
ABOVE it, so the Cleaning audit pack (no ``record_kind``) and projection/ECR records
keep writing generically.

Companions that close the v0 residuals: the write-path guard
``.agents/hooks/check_silver_lane_registry.py`` (a producer writing a Silver lane
through the raw writer instead of this front-door fails CI, save the named
FRONT_DOOR_PENDING lanes), and the no-blur NEGATIVE mirror
``data_lake.non_silver_record`` (a projection / cleaning-audit / ECR / signal-content
/ transcript record must not carry ``record_kind`` or this ``schema_version``, and
must carry its own role posture). Remaining residual: that negative mirror is enforced
by a conformance test, not yet wired into every producer's write path.
