# Skill Adoption

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Forseti overlay authority
scope: Forseti workflow skill recognition, adoption rules, source/deployment boundaries, and collision checks.
use_when:
  - Deciding whether Forseti may use or adopt workflow skills.
  - Checking resolver-visible skill evidence and skill-name collisions.
  - Preventing installed, user-level, plugin, or external skill source mutation from ordinary Forseti work.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

## Current Status

- Forseti has one accepted Forseti-local primary workflow skill source:
  `forseti-product-lead` (accepted/frozen as the primary product-lead skill ID
  on 2026-07-05; DEPLOYED/ACTIVATED for the Claude Code runtime,
  project-scoped — not user-global). See `## Accepted Forseti-Local Candidate
  Skills` below.
- Forseti has two additional owner-authorized local candidate sources:
  `creator-audience-triangulation`, which supplies the narrow
  onboarding/on-demand firing point, and `forseti-worktree-retirement`, which
  supplies the guarded high-concurrency worktree-retirement procedure. Neither
  is accepted/frozen or externally deployed.
- Forseti retains `orca-product-lead` as a legacy compatibility wrapper for one
  transition window. It is an alias into `forseti-product-lead`, not the primary
  skill identity.
- Forseti has no accepted global skill shadow candidates.
- Forseti has no same-name global skill promotions.
- Forseti may use resolver-visible workflow skills when explicitly invoked or
  selected by the active resolver. This does not make external workflow source
  documents Forseti authority.
- This recognition record does not install, update, validate, promote, or
  activate plugin skills. The current running thread may still expose an older
  skill registry until Codex reloads plugin metadata.
- Future reusable workflow skill adoption requires accepted skill source and
  validated deployment copies.

## Recognized Workflow Skills

These skills may provide task-local mechanics for Forseti work. They do not
provide Forseti project authority, product facts, artifact destinations,
validation gates, acceptance, readiness, resolver behavior, deployment status,
or implementation permission.

Observed on 2026-06-05:

- Marketplace source configured in `C:\Users\vmon7\.codex\config.toml`:
  `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\agent-workflow`.
- Source repo HEAD observed: `b78c268`; source worktree was dirty. Treat this
  as source-location evidence only, not clean-source acceptance.
- Source plugin manifest observed:
  `C:\Users\vmon7\Desktop\projects\agent-workflow\plugin\.codex-plugin\plugin.json`.
- Installed plugin cache observed:
  `C:\Users\vmon7\.codex\plugins\cache\agent-workflow-local\agent-workflow\0.1.52`.
- Installed package manifest observed:
  `C:\Users\vmon7\.codex\plugins\cache\agent-workflow-local\agent-workflow\0.1.52\skill_manifest_v1.json`.
- Installed plugin version observed: `0.1.52`.
- Package manifest `observed_repo_head_at_manifest_update`: `6c22334`; use the
  manifest's per-skill hashes for provenance, not this overlay file.
- Package-path readback: every `plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md` path listed in the
  `0.1.52` package manifest existed at readback.
- The deleted implementation-gate workflow is absent from the `0.1.52` package
  manifest and is not a recognized Forseti workflow tool.
- Previous recognized `workflow-compound-planning` entry from plugin cache
  `0.1.3` is stale; use `incremental-planning` for next-move sequencing.
- `workflow-cartographer` is present in the installed plugin package and in the
  active resolver-visible skill list for the current Codex thread. It is not
  present under `C:\Users\vmon7\.codex\skills`, which is an older user-level
  shadow surface and must not be treated as the Agent Workflow plugin inventory.

For strict provenance, open the installed `0.1.52` `skill_manifest_v1.json` and
the relevant `SKILL.md` before relying on any skill behavior. This overlay table
is a Forseti routing and collision record, not package validation or resolver
proof.

## Activation Caveat

A recognition record here reflects the plugin-cache state observed when it was
written; a running thread may still resolve against an older cache. If the
visible skill list looks stale, start a fresh thread or reload before relying on
automatic triggering or absence decisions, and disclose when active resolver
behavior was not proven in-thread.

## Adoption Rules

- Forseti-local candidate skills may be created and iterated only after explicit
  owner authorization for that named candidate.
- Candidate skills must stay Forseti-local until a separate promotion decision.
- Candidate skills are not Forseti authority. They must defer Forseti facts,
  artifact roles, review lanes, output modes, validation gates, and safety
  rules to `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/workflow-overlay/`.
- Candidate skills must record trigger examples, source boundary, collision
  status, rollback path, and validation notes before acceptance.
- Accept a Forseti-local candidate as frozen only when it is specific and narrowly
  scoped to a real Forseti lane (like `forseti-product-lead`), defers all Forseti facts to
  `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/workflow-overlay/`, carries the adoption metadata
  above, and has a re-confirmed collision check plus a pinned source hash. Do not
  accept broad, generic, or authority-claiming local skills. Acceptance is a
  local freeze only; it does not deploy, activate, or make the skill
  resolver-visible — that remains a separate Protected Skill Boundary action.
- Use shadow names before any same-name promotion.
- Re-check repo-local, installed global/system, user-level, plugin-contributed,
  and other resolver-visible skill names before adoption work.
- Record source path, source hash, overlay loaded, collision status, and
  rollback path for any adoption validation.
- Missing overlay authority must fail visibly when a reusable skill requires
  project facts.

## Owner-Authorized Candidate Sources

- `creator-audience-triangulation`
  - Source path: `.agents/skills/creator-audience-triangulation/SKILL.md`.
  - Normalized LF sha256: `e8508b1bc374dbe4c37f23dd935a66cfc9f176ffd16321844c757281ef8863dd`
    (observed 2026-07-15 after source creation).
  - Scope: full TikTok creator onboarding after Bronze admission, or explicit
    generation/refresh of one creator's transcript-plus-comment audience
    triangulation. Comparisons, copy critique, presentation review, comment
    analysis, Silver maintenance, and capture debugging are negative triggers.
  - Collision: no same-name repo/project, user Codex/Agents/Claude, or installed
    plugin skill directory was observed before creation on 2026-07-15.
  - Boundary: Forseti-local source only; not accepted/frozen, not user-global,
    not plugin-installed, and no external deployment claim.
  - Rollback: remove this source and this candidate record. Do not modify
    plugin, installed-cache, user-level, or external skill source.

- `forseti-worktree-retirement`
  - Source path: `.agents/skills/forseti-worktree-retirement/SKILL.md`.
  - Normalized LF sha256: `f0d14cdf5f570aca65400c5a7a2bdfbf28b279903c3065db4d7ea69dbc3ab69c`
    (observed 2026-07-18 after source creation).
  - Scope: explicit audits or retirement of Forseti Git worktrees, including
    stale-age or target-count requests. Ordinary branch cleanup, artifact
    deletion inside a worktree, implementation landing, and general repository
    hygiene are negative triggers.
  - Failure prevented: deleting an active, reused, dirty, unpushed, or uniquely
    valuable lane merely because it is old, merged-related, or above a desired
    count.
  - Collision: no same-name repo/project, user Codex/Agents/Claude, installed
    plugin-cache, or active resolver-visible skill directory was observed before
    creation on 2026-07-18. The distinct name avoids shadowing the recognized
    generic `workflow-repo-hygiene` skill.
  - Validation: `quick_validate.py`, the reused
    `.github/scripts/lane-health-check.ps1 -SelfTest`, hash-pin freshness,
    retrieval-header, and map-link checks passed. Three read-only forward
    scenarios covered age/count pressure, named unique-work discard with an
    unexpected remote, and dirty post-merge payload adjudication; each preserved
    the intended authority boundary. The contradiction/leakage scan found no
    same-name source or machine-local path. These are source-change results only,
    not deployment or resolver proof.
  - Boundary: Forseti-local source only; not accepted/frozen, not user-global,
    not plugin-installed, and no external deployment or resolver-visibility
    claim.
  - Rollback: remove this source and this candidate record. Do not modify the
    generic plugin skill, installed cache, user-level, or external skill source.

## Accepted Forseti-Local Candidate Skills

Forseti does accept Forseti-local candidate skills, but only specific, narrowly scoped
ones like the product-lead method below — never broad, generic, or
authority-claiming local skills. Acceptance is a LOCAL FREEZE only: it does not
deploy, activate, or make the skill resolver-visible; that remains a separate
skill-governance action under the Protected Skill Boundary.

- `forseti-product-lead` — accepted/frozen as the primary Forseti-local
  product-lead skill identity on 2026-07-05 after the Forseti repo/project
  identity cutover. Migrated from the legacy `orca-product-lead` command/path;
  the old command/path remains as a thin compatibility wrapper for one
  transition window.
  - Source path: `.agents/skills/forseti-product-lead/SKILL.md` (Forseti-local).
  - Source sha256: `671de6e4a0d0fdfc06279bdb6f5576c2190405a0760e537779bc7748b8d7c22b`
    (sha256 over CRLF-normalized bytes (LF), recomputed 2026-07-15 after the
    current-main auto-trigger narrowing and the controlling-thesis / beauty-
    application route refresh were combined; `.agents` source and `.claude`
    deployment copy were byte-identical at verification. Commit blob is
    reread-required after closeout).
    Reread-required if the file changes; pin freshness enforced by
    `.agents/hooks/check_hash_pin_freshness.py`.
  - Compatibility wrapper path: `.agents/skills/orca-product-lead/SKILL.md` with
    deployment copy at `.claude/skills/orca-product-lead/SKILL.md`.
  - Compatibility wrapper sha256: `21a2725265f14a79a7b35399b2240cbb76af9659d1e26506e09d9b99123bbc3f`
    (sha256 over CRLF-normalized bytes (LF), recomputed 2026-07-10 so the pin
    is checkout-independent, superseding the raw-CRLF Get-FileHash value
    observed 2026-07-05; source and deployment wrapper copies are
    byte-identical; git content blob
    `6411b8a9b8abd73386eb64109a85534f40ddf931` on both wrapper copies,
    re-verified 2026-07-10).
    The wrapper loads the sibling `forseti-product-lead` skill and carries no
    product method of its own.
  - Scope: prepares — does not freeze, run outreach, produce, or build — an
    explicitly requested owner-signoff decision about Forseti's own value
    proposition or offer, ICP / first-proof wedge, buyer-proof design, offer
    positioning / packaging / deliverable shape, or pull / kill / graduation.
    It does not auto-trigger on routine creator/audience profile work,
    copywriting, commercial-language refinement, feature/runtime work, or
    ordinary artifact review merely because those tasks mention clients,
    buyers, positioning, packaging, or commercial value. A thin router into
    Forseti product authority; defers every fact to `AGENTS.md`, the overlay,
    and the decision records; fails visibly when authority is missing.
  - Shadow name: distinct from the resolver-visible jb-scoped `product-lead`.
  - Collision (checked 2026-07-05): no repo-local, project-level Claude,
    user-level Codex, user-level Agents, or user-level Claude skill folder named
    `forseti-product-lead`; active in-thread resolver did not expose a
    `forseti-product-lead` skill before this source change. Existing
    `orca-product-lead` remains only as the repo/project compatibility wrapper;
    existing `product-lead` remains jb-scoped and is not imported.
  - Overlay loaded for migration: README, decision-routing, source-of-truth,
    skill-adoption, artifact-folders, validation-gates, source-loading, and the
    skill/preflight identity migration plan.
  - Deployment (2026-07-05): DEPLOYED/ACTIVATED for the Claude Code runtime as a
    project-level copy at `.claude/skills/forseti-product-lead/SKILL.md`
    (byte-identical to source; same sha256). Project scope only — not
    user-global (`~/.claude/skills/`), not plugin, not external. Sync rule: the
    `.agents/skills/forseti-product-lead/` file is source-of-record; on any
    source change, regenerate the `.claude/skills/forseti-product-lead/` copy and
    re-pin the sha256 here. Invocation: `/forseti-product-lead` (command name
    from the directory), its narrowed explicit product-direction description
    auto-trigger, or the Skill tool. Legacy invocation `/orca-product-lead`
    remains as a wrapper for one transition window. Codex / other-runtime
    activation is a separate target, not claimed by this record.
  - Retirement readiness (checked 2026-07-08): NOT READY. The `.claude`
    deployment copy was re-synced to the `.agents` source after current-main
    filename migrations left it stale; do not delete the `orca-product-lead`
    wrapper until resolver behavior and transition-window closure are verified.
  - Rollback: delete `.agents/skills/forseti-product-lead/` and
    `.claude/skills/forseti-product-lead/`; restore the full-method
    `orca-product-lead` copies from the previous commit; revert this record, the
    `.agents/skills/` entry in `artifact-folders.md`, and the status/repo-map
    rows updated by the migration. Do not edit plugin / user-level / installed /
    external skill source.
  - Boundary: not Forseti authority; Forseti-local only; project-scoped (not
    user-global, not plugin, not external).

## Protected Skill Boundary

Do not install, uninstall, rename, rewrite, shadow, or promote global,
user-level, plugin-contributed, installed, or external source skills from
ordinary Forseti product work.

Those actions require a separate explicit skill-governance authorization after
resolver-visible collision checks and rollback planning. The Forseti-local
candidate lane above does not grant that authority.

## Rollback

Rollback for this overlay recognition update is to remove the `0.1.52`
recognition sections and restore the prior recognized-skill record from Git or
human-approved notes. Rollback must not edit plugin source, installed plugin
cache files, global/user skill roots, or external workflow source.

## Known Snapshots

- The Turn 6 resolver-visible skill snapshot is recorded in
  `docs/workflows/orca_bootstrap_record.md`.
- The 2026-06-05 collision table above is the current recognition check for
  Agent Workflow plugin cache `0.1.52`.
