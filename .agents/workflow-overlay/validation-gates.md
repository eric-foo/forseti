# Validation Gates

```yaml
retrieval_header_version: 1
artifact_role: Forseti overlay authority
scope: Validation gates required before Forseti completion claims.
use_when:
  - Checking whether a Forseti completion, prompt, or artifact claim has required evidence.
  - Defining validation expectations for docs/decision work, explicitly authorized implementation work, prompts, and artifacts.
authority_boundary: retrieval_only
```

**Routine read shape** (owned by `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`,
Targeted Read Protocol): closeout checks read "Current Gates"; prompt
authoring reads "Prompt Orchestration Gates"; product-proof work reads
"Product Proof Gates"; enforcement-placement decisions read "Enforcement
Placement"; a full-file read is for editing validation doctrine.

Validation must be able to fail. Missing evidence is not a pass.

Validation reports must preserve failure visibility by bucket:

- `GATE PASS` / `GATE FAIL` are exit-code-bearing checks required for the claim.
- `INFO` / `DEBT` is explicit allowlisted non-gating output; it never changes the gate exit code.
- `OUT OF SCOPE` must name the owning lane or source surface; it cannot mean inconvenient or ignored.
- Unknown nonzero exits, unknown findings, and wrapper-internal errors default to `GATE FAIL`, never
  `INFO`. A future wrapper may encode this policy, but bucket membership is owned here; any wrapper
  script that encodes it must exit nonzero iff any `GATE FAIL` exists.

Throughout Forseti workflow doctrine, a `status claim` asserts acceptance or
approval; validation, readiness, or completion (including `PASS` or
`ADEQUATE_NOW`); implementation, deployment, installation, or resolver state;
source-of-truth promotion; or buyer pull / willingness to pay. A `strict status
claim` uses one of those states to clear a gate or authorize movement. Domain
owners may bind narrower tokens, but compressed references to status claims
inherit this floor.

## Current Gates

- Required Forseti files exist before claiming bootstrap completion.
- Diff-scoped CI gates bind one exact event base SHA: pull requests use
  `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`; pushes to `main` use
  `github.event.before`. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exports that value as
  `FORSETI_DIFF_BASE` and fails closed before policy gates when it is absent,
  all-zero, malformed, or unresolvable after full-history checkout. Checker
  resolution priority is `FORSETI_DIFF_BASE`, then `$GITHUB_BASE_REF`, then
  an explicit CLI base, then local `origin/main`. The local pre-push mirror
  deliberately leaves the CI variable unset and scans outgoing
  `origin/main...HEAD`; this event contract changes CI scope, not hook scope.
- Harness coupling contract preflight: when the exact CI event diff (or local
  outgoing `origin/main...HEAD` diff) touches `forseti-harness/**/*.py` or the
  generated `forseti-harness/data_lake/lake_touchpoint_inventory_v0.json`,
  `.agents/hooks/check_harness_coupling.py --strict` runs the existing
  `test_data_lake_inventory_gate.py` and `test_policy_module_version_pins.py`
  contract files before the full suite. Diff-resolution and launch errors fail
  closed. The adapter adds no test rule and a pass is not full-suite validation,
  readiness, approval, or proof that every CI failure is prevented.
- No software implementation directories are present unless explicitly authorized.
- `AGENTS.md` and overlay files do not encode `jb` project-specific authority as Forseti rules.
- Material authority, source-scope, edit-permission, and repository-state checks
  occur before repo-aware work. A `forseti_start_preflight` receipt is required
  only at the durable/cross-lane and portable strict-claim boundaries in
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`; missing receipt evidence blocks
  that portable handoff or claim, not ordinary interactive work.
- Doctrine-changing source work must include an inline
  `direction_change_propagation` receipt or explicit
  `direction_change_propagation_blocker` under
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-of-truth.md` before claiming completion.
  Missing propagation evidence blocks strict success or status claims that
  depend on the changed doctrine; it authorizes no adjacent cleanup or tooling.
- Receiver-binding acceptance is class-specific and uses the single inline
  `receiver_binding` receipt owned by
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md`:

  | Commission state | Acceptance result | Required evidence or recovery |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Codex managed-worktree task created with its initial commission | `accepted` after verification | Current root equals the app-created managed worktree; the bound clean revision mode passes; lane-start file write plus Git stage/unstage/cleanup probe passes; no concurrent writer; before any protected gate, the exact top-level live adoption probe owned by `decision-routing.md` is denied with `FORSETI_CODEX_HOOK_ADOPTION=ADOPTED`. |
  | External controller targeting another worktree | `accepted` after verification | Unique exact target and byte identity when dirty; demonstrated direct write; target-rooted operation; no concurrent writer. |
  | Collaboration subagent pointed at a separate worktree | `blocked` | Collaboration is same-root only; use a separately bound receiver rather than treating a named path as rerooting. |
  | Local/base-rooted Codex task with command-level `workdir` set to another worktree | `blocked` | A per-command directory override does not change task, hook, sandbox-root, or receiver identity; create the correctly rooted managed task. |
  | Unknown future/manual courier | `preparation_allowed`, dispatch and source loading `blocked` | Keep `receiver_class: receiver_to_bind`; bind and verify a concrete receiver before claiming dispatch readiness. |
  | Wrongly launched Codex task that creates or finds another worktree | `blocked` as `BLOCKED_RECEIVER_REROOT_REQUIRED` | Do not write the alternate worktree; create a new user-authorized Codex managed-worktree task with the commission in its initial prompt. |
  | Dirty, ambiguous, byte-mismatched, or concurrently written target | `blocked` | Resolve exact target/state and eliminate concurrent writing; missing evidence is not a pass. |

  This matrix accepts semantic user authorization for a new task or handoff when
  the visible instruction explicitly requests it; generic `proceed` alone is
  not task-creation authority. It does not weaken the Codex registered non-
  current-worktree denial or turn receipt fields into self-certifying proof.
  For clean repo-changing receivers, the `revision_mode` assertions are exact:
  `exact` requires a clean worktree and `HEAD == required_revision`; `ancestor`
  requires a clean worktree and a zero exit from
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <required_revision> HEAD`. `ancestor` is valid
  only where the commission explicitly permits an advancing lane; it never
  satisfies an existing exact gate. The observed live-probe denial is the hook
  adoption evidence; no persisted adoption field can clear this gate.
- Review-routing disposition gate: a change that touches code roots
  (`forseti-harness/`, `.agents/hooks/`) must carry its review disposition in the
  same change — either a review artifact added under `docs/prompts/reviews/`
  or `docs/review-outputs/`, or a shape-valid `review_routing_status:` line in
  one of the change's commit messages:
  `review_routing_status: routed <existing docs/prompts/reviews/... or docs/review-outputs/... path>`,
  `review_routing_status: blocked -- <reason>`, or
  `review_routing_status: not_needed -- <reason>`.
  A carried recommended or required adversarial review may close only as
  `routed` or `blocked`, never `not_needed` (the fused/review contracts own
  that vocabulary; this gate does not weaken it). The disposition is routing
  shape only: it is not review quality, review truth, severity authority,
  validation, or readiness, and the gate never decides whether review SHOULD
  have been recommended — that stays resident scoping judgment. Enforced
  diff-scoped and forward-only by `.agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py`
  (local `--commit-msg` advisory; CI `--strict`).
- Handoff-pointer resolution gate: a changed durable `.md` file must not
  reference a handoff-packet path (`docs/workflows/*handoff*.md`,
  `docs/prompts/handoffs/*.md`) that does not resolve in the same tree,
  unless the pointer line carries an explicit resolution pin (the word
  `branch`, `PR #<n>`, or an `origin/<ref>` token — a fetch handle for a cold
  reader) or an exemption marker (`does not exist yet`, `created on first`,
  `not retrieval-indexed`, `nonresolving:`, or superseded/removed/deleted
  wording for retired packets). Practical consequence: a handoff packet
  merges no later than the first main-bound artifact that points at it (the
  same PR is fine), or the pointer pins the authoring branch explicitly — a
  cold receiving lane resolves required reads from `origin/main`, not from
  unmerged authoring branches. The gate is pointer shape only: it never
  proves a packet's content is current, that a pinned branch still exists, or
  that the cited packet was the right source — that stays resident judgment.
  Couriers that never land in the repo (chat bodies, PR comments, ignored
  `docs/_inbox/` scratch) are outside its reach and stay governed by
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`. Enforced diff-scoped
  and forward-only by `.agents/hooks/check_handoff_pointers.py` (CI
  `--strict`; whole-corpus backlog via `--audit`, never gated).
- Source-input hash freshness gate: changed repo-local JSON `source_inputs[]`
  records that carry `source_pointer` + `sha256` must match current file bytes
  (CRLF-normalized), and source-capture packet manifests (top-level
  `manifest_version`) must have top-level `preserved_files[]` records whose
  `relative_packet_path` + `sha256` match current raw stored bytes resolved
  against the manifest's own directory, when the JSON artifact or referenced
  file changed. This is provenance freshness only: it is not semantic
  validation, generated-artifact completeness, readiness, source quality,
  capture freshness, or metric validity. Enforced diff-scoped and forward-only
  by `.agents/hooks/check_source_input_hashes.py` (CI `--strict`; local
  pre-push mirror; whole-repo advisory via `--audit`, never gated).
- Review-summary shape gate: a changed durable review output under
  `docs/review-outputs/` carrying a real (non-template) `review_summary`
  YAML block must keep the block's mechanically checkable shape from
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/communication-style.md`: none of the forbidden
  process keys, a `report_path` that resolves in the same tree, the bound
  failed-write shape when `status: failed` (no `report_path`,
  `recommendation: blocked`, `review_location: chat_only_current_thread`),
  and a non-blank `recommendation` when the key is present. Full
  `recommendation` vocabulary membership is advisory only (`--audit`):
  delegated-review-patch lanes carry an extended vocabulary that
  `communication-style.md` does not bind, and the owner accepted
  (2026-07-10) keeping enum membership advisory — the extended vocabulary
  stays unbound, the 5-value enum remains the canonical target for new
  summaries, and drift is tracked, never gated. The gate is
  summary shape only: it is not review quality, finding truth, severity
  authority, validation, or readiness; retrieval-header, provenance, and
  fencing checks stay with `check_review_output_provenance.py`. Enforced
  diff-scoped and forward-only by `.agents/hooks/check_review_summary.py`
  (CI `--strict`; whole-corpus advisory via `--audit`, never gated).
- Hash-pin freshness gate: markdown freshness hash pins in changed durable
  docs — labeled `path:` + `sha256:` bullet pairs (e.g. the skill-adoption
  source pins) and `source_captures/**/receipt.md` preserved-file bullets —
  must match the current CRLF-normalized bytes of their repo-local targets
  when the pin-carrying doc or the pinned target changed. Provenance-style
  records (package-manifest tables, source-read ledgers, external-repo
  bootstrap tables) are deliberately not parsed as pins: they record a past
  observation, and gating them would false-block working-as-intended
  history. This is pin freshness only: not semantic validity, source
  quality, capture freshness, skill correctness, validation, or readiness.
  The markdown sibling of the source-input hash freshness gate above.
  Enforced diff-scoped and forward-only by
  `.agents/hooks/check_hash_pin_freshness.py` (CI `--strict`; local pre-push
  mirror; whole-repo advisory via `--audit`, never gated).
- Ontology-tag validity gate: changed tracked Markdown files are scanned against
  the ontology SSOT roster over the CI event base (or local pre-push
  `origin/main...HEAD`); an additive annotation
  that looks like an ontology type but names no roster type fails. Deletions,
  untracked files, scratch, and nested worktrees are outside strict diff scope;
  `--check` retains the explicit whole-tree advisory scan. Enforced by
  `.agents/hooks/check_ontology_tag_validity.py` in CI and the local pre-push
  mirror. An unresolvable diff base fails open with a loud infrastructure-gap
  warning, never a pass claim. Tag-shape only: not ontology correctness,
  semantic validity, validation, readiness, or approval.
- Receipt-field provenance gate (non-self-certification): a gate, predicate,
  acceptance check, or completion claim must not clear on a self-asserted field
  value. A field clears only when it is owner-produced and provenance-bound or
  independently verifiable — computed, re-derivable, audited, or produced by an
  authorized process. A value a by-hand, unauthorized, dry-runner,
  local-fixture, manually normalized, or operator-authored record could simply
  assert is not self-certifying and does not clear, even when it reads `proven`,
  `pass_valid`, `valid`, or `complete`. Where no owner-produced or verifiable
  field exists yet, the check is `indeterminate_until_authored` (blocked, not
  passed); do not clear on a paraphrase and do not invent the field. Corollaries:
  (a) fix the whole class of such checks in one pass, not one instance; (b)
  verify a cited source actually defines the field before binding a check to it;
  (c) single-source any value otherwise enumerated in multiple places (enumerate
  once; reference it). This gate is a check, not validation or readiness
  evidence; its presence does not prove any artifact passes it. Lifecycle:
  Forseti-local adoption of general authoring/review discipline, not Forseti-owned
  doctrine; it is a candidate for future skill-source adoption and becomes
  stale here if an equivalent accepted skill-source rule is adopted.
- New or materially touched durable human-authored workflow artifacts follow
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` or are clearly outside that
  contract.
- New or materially touched durable artifacts close against `AGENTS.md`
  ("Artifact-Level Smallest Complete Intervention"): resident judgment must
  confirm a distinct future consumer, outcome, or lifecycle; standalone
  usability without authoring-chat reconstruction; the material authority,
  currentness, and next-source facts; no duplicated authority or speculative
  registry; and reconciliation of affected supersession, retirement, and live
  routers. Deterministic tooling may check objective router-target existence,
  but a green path check does not establish semantic completeness.
- Report-only retrievability checks may use
  `docs/workflows/artifact_retrievability_guide.md` for artifact body-opening
  shape, stale/recheck clarity, repo-map/index treatment, and hygiene anti-rot.
  Findings are routing or hygiene defects only; they do not prove validation
  failure, validation success, approval, readiness, lifecycle completion,
  implementation authorization, or edit permission.
- Repo-map T1 admission gate: a change that adds or materially expands a row in
  `docs/workflows/forseti_repo_map_v0.md` must identify which T1 class in
  `docs/decisions/forseti_repo_map_architecture_mgt_v0.md` it serves and why an
  existing area row, submap, retrieval header, or generated
  `header_index.py --index` route is insufficient. A valid path, passing link
  check, or freshness trigger is not admission evidence. Reviewers reject
  per-file inventory, historical chronology, embedded operating manuals, and
  duplicated owner-source descriptions. This gate is resident judgment: the
  existing retrieval checkers continue to enforce existence, reachability,
  freshness, and header shape only; none claims semantic T1 admission.
- Source hashes for migration-governance inputs are recorded in `docs/workflows/orca_bootstrap_record.md`.
- Resolver-visible skill-name snapshots are recorded before any skill adoption or promotion work.
- Git status is reported when this workspace is a Git repo.

## Conditional Cold-Agent Dogfood Gate

This gate applies only inside an explicitly invoked `/fused` source-changing
implementation turn. It targets operational-usability failures that can remain
invisible when the author retains setup knowledge, implementation rationale,
fixture familiarity, or the expected output in context. It is independent of
delegated different-family review: cold dogfood tests use without author
context; delegated review tests the implementation through a de-correlated code
reviewer. Neither substitutes for the other.

After focused tests and author-run validation, classify the implementation:

- `applicable` when it introduces or materially changes a supported
  user/operator workflow, CLI or runner, cross-layer integration,
  model-generated output with a bound invariant, onboarding or capture chain,
  safely exercisable external/lake boundary, or behavior whose usability is
  not adequately represented by unit/contract tests; and a representative
  non-production artifact can exercise the load-bearing path safely.
- `not_applicable` for documentation-only work unless the documentation is the
  supported entry point, mechanical refactors with unchanged behavior, narrow
  fixes whose relevant risk is fully represented by deterministic tests, work
  that cannot be exercised without live/production mutation, or work with no
  representative local artifact. Record the exact skip reason and accepted
  residual; do not convert an expected skip into `no_failure_found`.

An applicable first pass uses a fresh agent with no forked authoring
conversation. Give it only the goal, supported entry point, constraints, and
artifact location. Do not give it an implementation-rationale dump, a
sender-authored workflow walkthrough, or an expected answer.
The agent must discover repository instructions and the actual supported
workflow from the same operator-facing surfaces available to a real user:
repository instructions, supported entry-point documentation or help, and
produced artifacts or evidence. When source or documentation is itself the
supported product or entry point, reading that source is realistic use and
remains allowed. Otherwise, do not expose or inspect implementation internals,
diffs, author notes, or tests unless the supported workflow itself requires
them. The agent may read only those operator-facing surfaces and the supplied
artifacts, and may write only to bounded scratch; it must not patch source or
product artifacts, mutate live/production state, publish, or perform
destructive actions. A different vendor is not required
for coldness. The actor only needs enough capability to operate the supported
entry point, inspect evidence, exercise product-quality judgment, and return a
reproducible result. Current model/tier defaults stay operator/tooling-owned
under `docs/decisions/subagent_model_tiering_doctrine_v0.md`; no model name or
version belongs in this gate or Fused.

The smallest complete first pass is one representative end-to-end happy path
plus one falsification scenario aimed at the highest-risk seam. Add a second
entity/artifact only when cross-entity isolation, batching, attribution, or
aggregation is load-bearing. Do not expand the matrix unless the first pass
finds a failure or names a specific coverage gap. One successful run is not
validation, readiness, or proof of output quality.

The cold return carries exactly one `cold_dogfood_status`:

- `failure_found`: at least one decision-bearing deviation was observed;
- `no_failure_found`: the bounded scenarios completed without one;
- `blocked`: an applicable run could not start or complete for an unexpected
  environment, tooling, evidence, or execution reason; Fused stops;
- `not_applicable`: a named classification skip applies.

The status preserves the first-pass or skip outcome; repair and replay do not
overwrite it. Closeout separately records home adjudication and replay result.

Each returned failure contains the exact entry point and command; environment
and inputs; artifact/evidence paths; expected invariant; observed result;
reproducibility; severity and user consequence; classification as
implementation defect, usability defect, data limitation, or unsupported
expectation; and screenshots/output excerpts only when decision-bearing.
`no_failure_found`, `blocked`, and `not_applicable` still state the scenarios or
classification basis and relevant residuals. The packet returns to the home
lane in chat or bounded scratch by default; do not create a standalone report,
ledger, template, or skill. Existing artifact and handoff contracts apply only
when another consumer genuinely requires durable transport.

Sequence and repair are bounded:

1. run initial dogfood after focused tests/author validation and before a
   carried `recommended` delegated review;
2. keep first-pass detection separate from repair; the home lane adjudicates
   reported deviations, makes at most one bounded repair batch, and asks the
   same cold lane to replay only failed scenarios;
3. an unresolved material failure or failed replay blocks Fused closeout;
4. after delegated review and home adjudication, replay only affected dogfood
   scenarios when a kept patch changes exercised runtime behavior, supported
   entry points, setup/artifact discovery, evidence selection, output schema,
   failure handling, attribution, batching, aggregation, or entity isolation;
5. do not replay for comments, prose-only clarification, tests-only changes, or
   mechanically irrelevant edits.

A required review checkpoint keeps precedence. Fused must not pass a named
checkpoint merely to reach dogfood. After the delegated return is adjudicated
and implementation resumes, run applicable dogfood at the earliest safe point
before later recommended review or strict closeout.

The default cost cap is one cold-agent first-pass turn, the bounded scenarios
above, one home repair batch, one replay of failed scenarios, and at most one
post-review replay of affected scenarios. Broaden or make the gate mandatory
only when observed cold-only material failures repeatedly escape the
applicability classifier or cluster in a skipped class. Narrow it when a
representative run history shows no decision-bearing cold-only findings and
the added token/latency cost is not justified. These are owner steering
triggers, not permission to add a telemetry ledger or silently change scope.

## Prompt Orchestration Gates

- Overlay authority gate: `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md`
  must be read before prompt-orchestration work. Routine prompts carry the
  complete inline core; escalated prompts carry the portable start receipt and
  fields owned by `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md` and
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`.
- Artifact role gate: every prompt role must be bound in `.agents/workflow-overlay/artifact-roles.md` or another accepted Forseti overlay file.
- Source-resolution gate: external workflow sources do not provide Forseti authority; installed skills are deployment copies; `jb` project policy must not be imported.
- Worktree preflight gate: prompts state workspace, revision or hash,
  dirty-state allowance, target scope, and edit permission only when repository
  state matters. Before a repo-changing cross-lane dispatch loads receiver
  sources, resident judgment applies the class-specific acceptance matrix above
  and the receipt in `.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md`. Codex
  managed tasks require current-root equality and the lane-start write/index
  proof; only an external direct-write controller may use the two-root route;
  collaboration is same-root; an unknown courier is preparation-only. Naming or
  reading another worktree is not write proof. A genuine binding/capability
  failure returns `BLOCKED_RECEIVER_REROOT_REQUIRED` without bypassing the guard;
  a wrongly launched Codex task recovers through a newly authorized managed-
  worktree task carrying the initial commission, not self-rerooting.
- Control-plane source-state gate: repository-aware prompts, prompt-policy
  patches, workflow patches, and CA handoffs must classify controlling Forseti
  sources as clean, modified, untracked, stale, or not checked when those
  sources affect strict claims. Modified or untracked controlling sources may
  support advisory work, but strict status claims remain blocked unless owner
  acceptance or controlling authority is explicit.
- Output-mode gate: prompts must name exactly one output mode from `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`.
  The mechanically checkable shell — an output-mode declaration naming at
  least one closed-set token in a changed `docs/prompts/**` artifact
  (templates and READMEs excluded) — is enforced diff-scoped and forward-only
  by `.agents/hooks/check_prompt_output_mode.py` (CI `--strict`; backlog via
  `--audit`, never gated). Whether the mode is exactly one and correctly
  scoped to this artifact rather than a nested dispatch/receiver role stays
  resident judgment; multi-declaration and compound-token shapes are
  advisory INFO, never gate failures.
- Chat-output topology gate: prompt-policy patches, workflow patches, and
  reusable prompt templates touching chat output shape must check for
  contradictions between the general human-summary / agent-detail /
  optional courier-state rule in
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/communication-style.md` and output-mode exceptions
  in `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`.
  This is a collision gate, not a required-key checklist: decision-bearing chat
  should start with human-readable prose; agent detail should stay separate;
  courier state should stay compact and last when used; YAML should not be
  defaulted unless the user asks, an output mode requires it, an explicit
  output contract needs machine-shaped fields, or lane switching / handoff
  routing would materially benefit from compact courier YAML;
  `review-report` YAML-only chat remains tied to successful durable report
  writes; `file-write` receipts remain valid only when the durable artifact
  carries the human value and no material decision must be understood from chat;
  `paste-ready-chat` must be classified
  before template propagation; task-native structured outputs such as evidence
  tables must not be naively rewritten into verbose closeouts; already-correct
  active `review-report` prompts and stale one-offs must not be broad-synced;
  and extra courier keys or ritual non-claim fields must not be added merely to
  satisfy process metrics.
- Review-report topology gate: prompts and prompt-policy patches touching
  `review-report` must check that the saved-report exception is adjacent to the
  owning output-mode rule; the durable report remains the review artifact; chat
  YAML remains courier output; YAML-only chat is valid only after successful
  report write, explicit chat-only selection, or pre-write blockage; failed
  durable writes use `status: failed`, `recommendation: blocked`,
  `review_location: chat_only_current_thread`, and no `report_path`; the failed
  path is named in human-readable routing detail; no extra YAML keys are added
  for process metrics; retrieval metadata stays retrieval-only; active
  templates/prompts are patched or stale one-offs are queued for hygiene; and
  no validation, approval, readiness, resolver, lifecycle, install, deploy,
  merge-safety, or product-readiness claim is introduced.
- Review-doctrine gate: review prompts, review templates, review-output
  closeouts, and CA-facing review handoffs must keep review output
  findings-first by default; require adversarial artifact review prompts to
  invoke `workflow-adversarial-artifact-review` after source readiness or block
  strict claims as advisory-only; bind any formal verdict, severity contract,
  blocked/ready status, validation claim, readiness claim, mandatory
  remediation, patch queue, or executor-ready handoff; include
  `minimum_closure_condition` and `next_authorized_action` for actionable
  findings; define closure conditions as required end states rather than
  implementation instructions; label optional hardening as optional and
  non-required; exclude `patch_queue_entry` unless the lane is patch-queue
  review or patch/integration execution; preserve the Chief Architect
  consumption order from `.agents/workflow-overlay/communication-style.md`; and
  avoid creating a synthesis lane. Missing or contradictory doctrine binding
  blocks strict `PASS`, readiness, acceptance, validation, or
  alignment-complete claims.
- Thread operating target continuity gate: when a generated workflow prompt,
  wrapper, rerun, review prompt, patch prompt, or handoff continues the same
  workstream or claims to optimize for the same anchor goal, a visible active
  `thread_operating_target` must be carried forward verbatim near the top of
  the prompt with the continuity disclosure from
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`, or the omission must be
  explained. Omission without explanation is a prompt-quality defect. The
  target is thread-local orientation only, not source authority, validation
  evidence, readiness, approval, lifecycle completion, workflow sequencing
  authority, durable memory, or edit permission.
- Source-heavy economy gate: prompts that require public web/source research,
  several external page opens, source ledgers, post-window comparisons, or
  several large artifact reads must define a source-loading unit and require the
  unit artifact to be written and hashed before the next unit starts.
- Source-capsule budget gate: source capsules must stay within the budgets in
  `.agents/workflow-overlay/source-loading.md`. If the budget is exceeded, the
  prompt must narrow the question, split the source-loading unit, or move to a
  new-thread handoff instead of compressing broader history into the capsule.
- Compaction-before-seal gate: if context compacts before the current
  source-heavy unit artifact is written and hashed, the run must stop as
  `BLOCKED_COMPACTION_BEFORE_ARTIFACT_SEAL`; any partial outputs from that unit
  are contaminated scratch until archived or cleanly rerun.
- Readback economy gate: prompt validation must use targeted existence, hash,
  marker, status, and count checks. It must not require full artifact echo, full
  ledger-row echo, pasted Evidence Units, or broad source dumps unless a
  targeted failure makes that exact excerpt necessary.
- Retrieval-metadata gate: new or materially touched durable prompt artifacts
  must follow `.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` without using
  retrieval metadata as authority, validation proof, approval, readiness,
  lifecycle completion, deployment/install/resolver status, or edit permission.
- Rerun economy gate: retry prompts must name the prior artifact, frozen decisions, mutable fields, and unresolved finding.
- Leakage gate: prompt artifacts must not copy `jb` templates, GAP/CV Engine paths, compiler paths, handoff rules, product-lead rules, or repo-local lifecycle mechanics.

## Product Proof Gates

- Judgment Spine claim-tier gate: Judgment Spine product-learning,
  buyer-proof, advisory, backtest, fixture, model-run, scoring, memo, deck,
  calibration, architecture, spec, prompt, wrapper, and runbook artifacts must
  classify the claim tier and closeout state using
  `forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_ladder/judgment_spine_evidence_ladder_architecture_v0.md` before
  making proof, readiness, validation, fixture-admission, scoring,
  blind-use-readiness, or judgment-quality claims. Product-Learning evidence
  cannot be reused as Buyer-Proof or Judgment-Quality evidence without the
  explicit promotion gate for the stronger tier. Classifications must apply the
  ladder's weakest-cleared-gate rule: source-quality and execution-quality gaps
  cap the claim at the lowest cleared gate, and missing evidence is not a pass.
  If no durable evidence exists for the evaluated run, answer, proof, scoring,
  or judgment-quality claim, the closeout state is `no_durable_evidence`.
  The classification must appear inline in the artifact being classified or
  co-reference a durable classification record with a path, hash, or equivalent
  retrieval handle.
  Architecture, spec, prompt, wrapper, and runbook artifacts are design or
  product-learning inputs by default; they are not Buyer-Proof or
  Judgment-Quality evidence unless the stronger tier's receipt is satisfied.

- Objection/refusal gate: product-proof, customer-discovery, buyer-proof, memo,
  deck, and readback artifacts must not treat initial buyer skepticism as a
  kill criterion. They must classify skepticism as `trust_objection` unless
  the buyer refuses the evidence type regardless of evidence quality, examples,
  numbers, mechanism, case logic, or proof experience.
- Trust-refusal gate: only `trust_refusal` may disqualify on public-signal
  trust grounds. `trust_objection` is proof material and must be captured,
  tested, and read back when other qualification gates pass.
- Pull-versus-praise gate: product-proof artifacts must distinguish observable
  decision or budget-adjacent behavior from approval language, praise,
  curiosity, generic research interest, or requests for source volume.
- Zero-spoiler backtest gate: case-study, consulting-case, preflight,
  participant-packet, and backtest artifacts must not expose actual decisions,
  consulting recommendations, implementation actions, post-cutoff facts,
  outcomes, result quality, or leaking source titles/snippets/URLs before the
  owner or participant blind judgment is sealed. If leakage occurs, the
  participant-facing packet is contaminated and must be rebuilt from clean
  pre-cutoff sources before blind use.

## Enforcement Placement

A load-bearing rule that is mechanically checkable at a tool boundary is
enforced there — a write-time hook plus a portable checker with a `--strict`
commit/CI mode — rather than carried only as an instruction, which fires only
when the model attends to it. The checker references the rule's authority and
never restates it; it is advisory and forward-only by default. Judgment-based
rules (claim discipline, scope, lifecycle reasoning) stay resident and still
must actually fire, not merely be present; a substrate enforces shape, never
truth (cf. the receipt-field provenance gate above). The per-rule
classification and the owner gate for building each substrate live in
`docs/decisions/overlay_enforcement_placement_classification_v0.md`.

Receiver-mechanism selection is one such judgment rule: whether a commission is
read-only, safe same-root contribution, or an independent repo-changing lane
depends on the requested act and live harness capability. The existing Codex
adapter deterministically blocks registered non-current-worktree writes at the
write boundary. An independent external controller may use a different launch
checkout only when it proves direct access to the exact effective target under
the owning two-root rule. Do not add a registry, daemon, or static prompt
checker that pretends it can prove a future receiver's runtime capability.

The Codex live adoption probe is the matching fail-closed runtime assertion:
the live `PreToolUse` adapter denies one exact harmless top-level command with
the stable adopted marker, while absent/unloaded wiring executes the adapter's
direct fallback and exits nonzero with the stable not-intercepted marker. This
proves only adoption for that live task; it is not persisted state, trust
metadata, or a Forseti-owned substitute for Codex's project-hook trust UI.

Active instance: the retrieval-header check
(`.agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py`, EP-06) enforces
`.agents/workflow-overlay/retrieval-metadata.md` at the write boundary and is
registered in the repo map's "Active Hooks" note; reuse this pattern for the
next such rule. Placement decides where a rule is enforced, not whether it is
correct: a passing check is not validation, readiness, approval, or
source-of-truth promotion.

**Live-router direct-target check** (`.agents/hooks/check_map_links.py`, C5).
The existing map/link gate also checks the authoritative-target column of the
Artifact Roles `Role Bindings` table and the Doctrine Index product-spine table.
Each live row must carry a repo-rooted target that exists directly in the
current tree; moved-path indexes do not satisfy a live router. This is objective
path existence only — not authority, currentness, semantic completeness,
validation, readiness, or proof that the routed source is the right one.

**Retrieval-header index + forward-only CI gate** (`.agents/hooks/header_index.py`).
Companion to EP-06. Adds three non-blocking surfaces and one CI gate:
- `--index`: full retrieval view of all header-bearing durable docs (human use).
- `--health [--verbose]`: whole-repo advisory counts of MISSING-HEADER and ORPHAN
  docs; exit 0 always (backlog surfaced, not gated).
- `--health --oneline`: single capsule line emitted by `session_context_capsule.py`
  at session start so every lane sees the advisory health count without walking the
  tree itself.
- `--strict`: **CI gate — diff-scoped, forward-only.** For changed durable `.md`
  files only (vs the CI event base, PR branch fallback, or local
  `origin/main`): fails (exit 1) if a
  changed doc is MISSING-HEADER or is an ORPHAN (not substring-found in the repo
  map or any submap).  Pre-existing backlog is never gated — only new/changed docs
  are in scope.  Fails OPEN (exit 0) if diff-scoping is unavailable; never falls
  back to whole-repo strict.
Registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after the existing link-check step.

**Google search-surface route guard**
(`.agents/hooks/check_search_surface_google_route.py`). Diff-scoped CI plus
advisory PostToolUse checker for the mechanically checkable shell of
`docs/decisions/search_surface_google_parameterized_us_capture_route_v0.md`:
Google Search capture URLs in changed durable docs carry the bound route
parameters; artifacts using the route carry the physical-locality non-claim; and
blocked Google pages with visible exit-IP content are not preserved in durable
docs. This is route-shape enforcement only. It is not physical-locality proof,
source sufficiency, validation, readiness, demand proof, Judgment evidence, or
Product Lead evidence.

**Retrieval-header forbidden-field scan** (`.agents/hooks/check_retrieval_header.py`,
EP-07 forbidden-field subset — the part previously deferred). The shared header
predicate (`header_problems_for_lines`, used by both the write-time `--hook` and
the `header_index.py --strict` CI gate) now also rejects status-leak keys in a
retrieval header — approval / validation / readiness / lifecycle / deployment /
install / resolver / publication / source-of-truth status — referencing
`retrieval-metadata.md` ("Forbidden Header Fields"), never restating it.
Born-green (no current in-scope header uses these keys). `edit_permission` /
`verdict` / `status` are intentionally NOT banned: review-output and prompt
frontmatter legitimately carry them. A `use_when` 1–3 count and a closed
allowed-key set were assessed and intentionally NOT enforced — the corpus mixes
retrieval-header fields with required review/prompt-provenance frontmatter in one
block, so neither is born-green. Placement enforces header shape, never truth.

**Doctrine-change receipt-shape gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_dcp_receipt.py`,
EP-09 shape subset). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate (a sibling to the
deletion-evidence gate): for changed `.md` files it validates that any real
`direction_change_propagation` receipt or `direction_change_propagation_blocker`
present is shape-valid — required keys present, `trigger` / `related_triggers`
drawn only from the seven controlled trigger values, `non_claims` a non-empty
list — referencing `source-of-truth.md` (Doctrine Change Propagation Contract),
never restating it. It validates SHAPE only: it does NOT decide whether an edit
is doctrine-changing, so it never requires a receipt to be *present* (the EP-09
over-edge stays resident judgment), and it never asserts a listed
controlling/downstream surface was truly updated or checked. Contract template
blocks and non-receipt note-markers are skipped. The inline-receipt cap and "no
new standalone receipt files" rule are deliberately NOT gated here; they remain
advisory hygiene, while the former archive-pointer requirement is retired.
Registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; whole-repo `--audit` is maintenance-
only for checker/contract changes or explicit legacy-corpus repair, never routine
change validation; `--selftest` present.

**Review-routing disposition gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_review_routing.py`,
EP-35). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate plus a local commit-msg advisory: a
change touching code roots must carry its review disposition — a review
artifact filed in the same change, or a shape-valid `review_routing_status`
line (grammar owned by the Current Gates bullet above), with `routed` paths
verified to exist. Born from the 2026-07-02 fused-lane audit: most fused
implementation lanes closed without filing the delegated-review handoff their
contract carried, several claimed it in commit prose without filing it, and
the disposition lived only in chat where nothing durable could check it
(51 of 67 code-root landings in the trailing 120 main commits carried no
disposition at build time — advisory backlog via `--audit`, never gated).
The gate checks disposition PRESENCE and SHAPE only — never the truth of a
`not_needed` reason, the quality of a filed review, or whether review should
have been recommended (resident judgment; cf. the receipt-field provenance
gate). Registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.githooks/commit-msg`;
`--selftest` present.

**Local pre-push selected-gate mirror** (`.agents/hooks/pre_push_guard.py`, the
policy behind the `.githooks/pre-push` adapter). For a push whose update lines
pass the guard's safety checks, the guard runs ten selected strict CI gates over the
outgoing `origin/main...HEAD` change: retrieval links and headers, review
routing and review-output provenance, source-input and markdown hash freshness,
prompt output mode, handoff-pointer resolution, ontology tag validity, and the
conditional harness coupling contracts.
The same checker modes run in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; CI supplies its
exact event base while pre-push supplies local `origin/main`; the mirror adds
no rule. A
nonzero or unlaunchable gate blocks the push (the GATE FAIL bucket above); the
checkers' documented infra-gap fail-opens remain loud and unchanged. The four
gates added 2026-07-11 were selected from observed CI failure frequency and
measured locally before adoption: prompt output mode, review provenance, and
handoff pointers completed in under 0.2 seconds each; ontology tag validity was
first converted from an 18-second whole-worktree walk that captured untracked
nested worktrees to a tracked, diff-scoped gate. Local Git hook only: bypassable
with `--no-verify`; it does not see GitHub API merges; CI remains the
authoritative boundary. A green pre-push is not validation, readiness, approval,
or proof that every CI step will pass.

**Harness coupling contract preflight**
(`.agents/hooks/check_harness_coupling.py`). This is a conditional adapter over
the two existing contract files named in Current Gates, not a new validation
rule. It runs in CI immediately before the full suite and in the local pre-push
selected-gate mirror. The trigger is deliberately broad across harness Python
because policy-module pins can be affected through imports and deliberately
narrow across non-Python data to the generated inventory snapshot. A 2026-07-15
sample of the latest 100 `ci` workflow runs found 96 completed runs and six
failures; three of the six failures were stale generated-inventory or
policy-module-pin coupling. No SHA in the sample both failed and later passed,
so blanket retry had no supporting evidence. The two contract files completed
in about 8.6 seconds locally versus about 79 seconds for the full harness suite.
This placement is the smallest complete response to the repeated fast coupling
class; other isolated failures remain visible in the authoritative full suite.


**Source-input hash freshness gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_source_input_hashes.py`,
EP-37). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate plus local pre-push mirror for the
Current Gates bullet above: list-style JSON `source_inputs[]` records with
repo-local `source_pointer` + `sha256` must match current file bytes when the
JSON artifact or referenced source changed. Born from PR #817: a Creator
Registry ledger merge changed the ledger hash while the YouTube metric seed's
source-input hash stayed stale, and full pytest caught it late. Extended
2026-07-10 to source-capture packet manifests: a JSON document with a
top-level `manifest_version` string has its top-level `preserved_files[]`
records (`relative_packet_path` + `sha256`) checked against current **raw
stored bytes**, with the path resolved against the manifest's own directory
(the manifests' `hash_basis: raw_stored_bytes`; `.gitattributes` pins
`**/source_captures/** -text`). Non-packet-local paths fail loud; nested
`preserved_files` blocks (review-input fixtures describing machine-local
packets outside the repo) are deliberately not matched. Gap surfaced by the
EP-15 build survey (PR #842): the packet-manifest shape was matched by
neither the `source_inputs[]` JSON gate nor the markdown pin-grammar gate.
Registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.agents/hooks/pre_push_guard.py`;
`--audit` and `--selftest` present. Provenance shape/freshness only — a green
run never proves semantic validity, completeness, readiness, source quality,
capture freshness, or metric validity.

**Handoff-pointer resolution gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_handoff_pointers.py`,
EP-36). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate for the Current Gates bullet above:
handoff-packet paths referenced in changed durable docs must resolve in the
same tree, or the pointer line must carry an explicit pin or exemption marker.
Born from repeated cold-agent resolution failures: packets authored on
unmerged lane branches — e.g. `docs/workflows/yt_shorts_grid_tier_assessment_handoff_v0.md`, reachable only on its authoring branch — were
referenced by filed courier/patch prompts that landed on `main`, so receiving
agents and delegated reviewers starting cold from `main` could not find them
(both the receiving agent and a delegated reviewer failed on that packet; the
`--audit` backlog at build time showed 17 unresolved pointers across at least
six distinct packets — surfaced, never gated). Because the gate runs on the
landing PR's tree, it mechanically enforces the merge-ordering rule without
needing to see lane starts. A write-time PostToolUse advisory was
intentionally NOT built: the defect is a merge-topology property (packet on a
different unmerged branch), invisible at the write boundary where the packet
usually exists in the author's own tree. Registered in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `--selftest` present. Pointer shape only — a
green run never proves packet content, freshness, or pin truth.

**Prompt output-mode gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_prompt_output_mode.py`,
EP-11 shape subset). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate for the Output-mode
gate bullet (Prompt Orchestration Gates above): a changed prompt artifact
under `docs/prompts/**` (templates and READMEs excluded) must carry an
output-mode declaration naming at least one token from the closed set in
`.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md` § Output Modes,
referencing that owner, never restating it. Build-time corpus measurement
falsified the literal "exactly one" substrate reading — the `output_mode:`
field shape is legitimately reused for receiver/reviewer/dispatch roles
within one prompt, and legitimate compound two-token values exist — so the
gate checks presence + token-in-set only, multi-declaration and multi-token
shapes are INFO (never gated), and the EP-11 classification row moved
SUBSTRATE→PARTIAL. Registered in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `--selftest`
present, including a token-drift assertion that parses the owning section;
no new write-time hook (`check_prompt_provenance.py` already reminds at that
boundary).

**Review-summary shape gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_review_summary.py`,
EP-10 born-green subset). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate for the
Review-summary shape gate bullet above (shape source
`.agents/workflow-overlay/communication-style.md`, referenced never
restated). Strict scope is deliberately the born-green subset: forbidden
process keys, `report_path` resolution, failed-write consistency, and
non-blank `recommendation`; full `recommendation` enum membership runs
`--audit`-only because delegated-review-patch lanes carry an extended
vocabulary `communication-style.md` never bound (measured on roughly 40% of
one recent week's real closeouts at build time) — the owner decided
(2026-07-10) to keep the narrowed gate as standing: the vocabulary stays
unbound, enum membership stays advisory, and re-widening is a future
doctrine change, not a checker default. Non-overlap:
retrieval-header, provenance, and fencing checks stay with
`check_review_output_provenance.py`. No write-time hook by design: review
outputs are frequently authored by other harnesses that never fire this
harness's hooks, so CI on the landing tree is the boundary. Registered in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `--selftest` present.

**Hash-pin freshness gate** (`.agents/hooks/check_hash_pin_freshness.py`,
EP-15 freshness subset). Diff-scoped, forward-only CI gate plus local
pre-push mirror for the Hash-pin freshness gate bullet above. Build-time
corpus survey found six markdown sha256 grammars; only the two freshness
grammars are parsed — labeled `path:` + `sha256:` bullet pairs (the
skill-adoption source pins) and `source_captures/**/receipt.md`
preserved-file bullets — while package-manifest tables, source-read
ledgers, and the external-path bootstrap-record table are provenance
records and deliberately unparsed (gating them would false-block
working-as-intended history). Hashes compare CRLF-normalized and
case-insensitive; the two skill-adoption pins were re-pinned in the same
change from raw-CRLF Get-FileHash values (which would pass on CRLF checkouts
and permanently fail on LF CI checkouts) to the normalized convention. The
markdown sibling of the EP-37 JSON gate. Registered in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.agents/hooks/pre_push_guard.py`;
`--selftest` present.
