"""Daemon-ready runner: project every committed fragrance-review packet into coverage.

The seam-shaped CATCH-UP entrypoint for the fragrance-review projection lane — the
first projection-family lane on the consumption seam. Until now the coverage
projection was written only when an operator pointed
``source_capture.fragrance_review_lake.project_fragrance_review_into_lake`` at one
packet: the lane had NO discovery, so a teed packet nobody pointed at never got its
derived coverage record. This runner independently scans committed availability and
derives for every packet whose current obligation is not yet acknowledged.

Pickup is the consumption seam (``data_lake.consumption``). The obligation snapshot is
policy-only: the raw packet is immutable (write-once), the coverage projection is
rebuilt in memory from the preserved widget bodies, and no committed derived record is
consumed — so the derivation has no growable derived-record inputs, and the coverage
method/version/certification plus the named selection-policy constants are the lane's
only re-trigger inputs. Skip-if-done keys on the ACK: each derivation appends a fresh
ULID sibling and the ack cites it; a crash mid-derivation leaves an unreferenced
sibling and NO ack, so the packet re-surfaces and re-derives cleanly.
Contract: ``core_spine_v0_data_lake_consumption_seam_contract_v0.md``.

DETERMINISM (the lane's one date-relative input): the coverage selection policy is
recency-windowed and ``build_fragrance_review_coverage`` defaults its ``as_of_date``
to ``date.today()`` — acceptable for an operator run, wrong for a catch-up whose
derived bytes must be a pure function of (immutable raw, policy). This runner pins
``as_of_date`` to the packet's own capture date via
``fragrance_review_lake.capture_as_of_date`` (manifest slice ``timing.capture_time``,
hash-verified against the availability entry), records the resolved date in the ack
evidence (the coverage receipt does not carry it), and declares the rule as the
``as_of_policy`` envelope token. A packet whose capture time cannot be resolved is a
loud per-packet ``derive_failed`` — never a silent ``today()`` fallback.

SURFACE GATE: the ``fragrance_review`` family has exactly one known surface (the
rendered-widget review tee). There is no sibling lane owning other surfaces, so there
is no known-out-of-scope ack path: any other surface is an unrecognized family member
and surfaces as a visible ``unsupported_surface`` status, never an ack (no open-world
acking). Classifying a future second surface is a deliberate policy change here.

Failure stays loud and isolated per packet: a missing availability entry is a
``discovery_failed`` status; a verified-read/resolution/derivation raise is a
``derive_failed`` status; both leave the packet unacknowledged and re-surfacing every
run. An ack write failure surfaces as ``ack_failed``. Acked-and-unchanged packets emit
NO per-run status entries. Per-packet availability reconcile failures surface as
``availability_reconcile_failed`` (the F-ECR-001 adjudicated shape) while healthy
packets still index and process.

No-LLM zone (`runners/`): the projection is mechanical (JSON decode + coverage build)
— this runner needs no transport, so ``--run`` IS the cadence entrypoint.
