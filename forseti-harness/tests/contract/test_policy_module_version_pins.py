"""Version-bump gate: derivation-policy modules cannot change silently.

Every consumption-seam obligation envelope enumerates version tokens (and
named constants) whose job is to re-surface committed packets when policy
changes. But the tokens only work if humans remember to bump them — until now
that discipline was COMMENT-BOUND (the standing residual named in every
catch-up adjudication: change ``cleaning/fragrantica.py`` internals without
bumping a version and no packet ever re-derives).

This gate makes the discipline mechanical: each derivation-policy module's
LF-normalized source hash is pinned here. Changing a pinned module fails CI
with a directed ritual instead of drifting silently:

1. Decide whether the change is OUTPUT-SHAPING (could any derived byte,
   selection, status, or ack fingerprint differ for the same committed raw?).
2. If output-shaping: bump the module's version token(s) named below — that
   re-fingerprints obligations and re-surfaces every committed packet, which
   is exactly the seam's S3 behavior.
3. Update the pin here either way, stating the decision in the commit.

Deliberately noisy: every change to these modules forces the conscious
decision that comments used to beg for. Modules pinned = the implementation
modules of every derivation whose version tokens appear in a
``_packet_obligation`` envelope (plus ``fragrance_review_lake.py`` and
``transcript_product_lake.py``, whose projection/write internals currently
ride sibling tokens — the named weak-envelope residuals).
