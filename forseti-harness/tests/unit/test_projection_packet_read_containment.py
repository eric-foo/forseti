"""Regression: projection packet reads are contained to the packet directory.

2026-07-17 hardening. Before this, only ``ig_projection`` rejected a
``relative_packet_path`` that was absolute or escaped the packet root via
``../``; basenotes/parfumo read with no containment check at all and
fragrantica checked existence only. The guard now lives once in
``source_capture.projection_shared`` and every projection surface's
``_read_packet_directory`` must BE the shared, guarded reader — the identity
tests below fail if any surface regresses to a private copy.
