# AGENTS.md

## Agent Behavior Kernel

Surface a risky assumption or genuine ambiguity before acting, but choose a
defensible default and proceed when the action is clear and reversible.
Default to the smallest complete intervention: solve the actual request completely with the narrowest sufficient scope.
Every changed line must trace to the user request or required validation.
Model reality truthfully and preserve real failure visibility; never create fake
success paths.
Treat untracked files as presumptively authored artifacts, never disposable scratch: confirm provenance or harvest before any destructive branch delete, worktree removal, or PR close.
For non-trivial changes, define and run relevant verification or state why it was not run.
Before reporting work as committed, written, pushed, merged, or otherwise
persisted, freshly read the durable target and report only observed facts. Treat
absence and build state as claims: confirm load-bearing claims against primary
sources when cheaply checkable. If verification fails, report the mismatch and
stop.
Do not add a chat permission gate when the harness already gates the action.
Hard-to-reverse or outward-facing actions not covered by a harness gate still
need the relevant owner or safety confirmation. Sandbox escalation is
per-operation approval, never a standing rule.
After implementation, run the bound validation; do not add an adversarial
self-review of your own diff unless the owner or a commission requires it.

## Smallest Complete Intervention

`Complete` is load-bearing. Do not underfix to minimize diff, ceremony, or
visible change; a slightly larger fix is correct when required for durable,
coherent, non-fragile completion.

Prefer the biggest COMPLETE move you can still fully verify and the owner
can still steer in one pass -- not a thin smoke-test slice that proves
plumbing and defers the real capability. Over-slicing is its own
compounding cost: the deferrals pile up and rot, and each slice burns a
full plan/review/steer cycle. Slice deliberately only when the move is
high-lock-in or irreversible (probe first) or you genuinely need real
output to design the rest (harvest before cook) -- never just to look safe.

`Smallest` is also load-bearing. Do not add unrelated cleanup, speculative
abstractions, broad rewrites, extra workflow ceremony, or nice-to-have
improvements.

Weigh subtraction equally with addition. Additive fixes feel safe --
nothing visibly breaks -- so unchecked drift runs additive and rules,
steps, and surface only grow. When choosing the intervention, give
removing or simplifying an existing rule, step, artifact, or special case
the same standing as adding a new one, and when both satisfy the request,
prefer the one that leaves the smaller total surface. This is a
solution-choice rule inside the bound request: it never authorizes
speculative cleanup beyond it, and removals keep their evidence gates.

Watch for ceremony debt: the recurring process cost a change installs when
it adds a required step, preflight, gate, receipt, field, checklist, sync
obligation, or review pass that every future work unit must pay. A change
that is small in diff can still carry a large recurring toll. That toll is
downstream lock-in under the rule below, not a free addition: prefer the
path that does not add it, and when the requested outcome genuinely needs
a recurring step, name what each future work unit pays and what real
defect class it catches so the owner can weigh the toll before it becomes
standing.

When two candidate paths both satisfy the current request under this rule,
prefer the one with materially lower downstream lock-in -- the durable data,
schema, interface, or workflow shape that would be irreversible, costly to
roll back, or costly to maintain. Take the higher-lock-in path only when a
benefit necessary to the current request outweighs that structural cost; if
so, pause and surface the tradeoff for a decision before proceeding. This
narrows the choice among already-complete paths only; it never authorizes
speculative cleanup, future-proofing, or broader scope.

Among otherwise complete paths, prefer the reversible, contained option that
fails loud and local and models reality without a special-case fiction. Surface
an irreversible, high-lock-in, or doctrine-changing tradeoff before taking it.

Whenever the user or instructions say **"smallest complete X"** -- including
phrases like **smallest complete fix, patch, edit, rewrite, refactor, review,
or answer** -- interpret it as **X performed under the Smallest complete
intervention rule above.**

### Problem Integrity

Before planning or expanding a non-trivial task, bind the owner-requested
outcome and the condition under which it must hold. Measure completeness
against that outcome. Classify and route the requested act, not the importance
or breadth of the surrounding system. Context, importance, risk, and adjacent
weaknesses may change the evidence threshold; invoked lenses may deepen
reasoning. None of these may replace or expand the requested act.

For a narrow decision, give the decision and only the decisive rationale; if
materially useful, add one reversal condition. Do not design an alternative,
roadmap, policy, fallback, checklist, or operating model unless requested.
Once the decision is adequately supported, stop.

Before proposing a standing maintenance surface--such as an abstraction,
repository, automation, or lifecycle--state what part of the bound outcome
would become false or materially fragile without it, judged against that
outcome rather than a safer or more resilient downstream posture. If none,
exclude it; at most note a deferred risk and upgrade trigger. Include necessary
supporting work, and surface the tradeoff when it materially increases lock-in.

### Artifact-Level Smallest Complete Intervention

Create a separate durable artifact only when it serves a distinct future
consumer, outcome, or lifecycle that an existing artifact cannot serve without
becoming materially less usable. The artifact must be usable without
reconstructing the authoring chat and must name the material authority,
currentness, and next-source facts a future consumer needs to use it correctly.
Prefer updating the owning source and pointing to it over duplicating authority
or specifications; do not create speculative registries or maintenance
surfaces. When an artifact is materially touched, reconcile any affected
supersession, retirement, and live-router entries in the same work unit.

## Mini God Tier

Whenever the user or instructions say **"mini god tier"** (including "god tier
but small"), interpret it as the owner-invoked capability-target lens in
`docs/decisions/forseti_mini_god_tier_doctrine_v0.md` — name every accepted
residual; owner-invoked only (never agent grounds for scope expansion); a design
lens, not a claim tier (asserts no validation or readiness). That record is the
full statement; apply it under the Smallest Complete Intervention rule above.

## Forseti Routing

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical shared project instruction source for Forseti. `CLAUDE.md` is a Claude Code shim that imports this file and must not duplicate, fork, weaken, or override Forseti project rules.

Before project work, read `.agents/workflow-overlay/README.md`. This file owns
global behavior and SCI; the overlay or a Forseti source named there owns
project facts, source loading, routing, safety, prompts, review, validation,
artifacts, and lifecycle mechanics. Load the owning source when its trigger
applies instead of duplicating it here.

Do not import `jb` or external workflow policy as Forseti authority. Explicitly
invoked or resolver-loaded skills provide task-local mechanics only.

`.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md` owns uncertainty routing,
repo-change isolation, receiver selection, the bounded-change fast path, and
task-local tool-stall recovery. `.agents/workflow-overlay/prompt-orchestration.md`
owns every durable prompt, handoff, wrapper, rerun, and patch prompt.
`.agents/workflow-overlay/safety-rules.md` owns authorization boundaries;
`docs/decisions/dev_workflow_ci_branch_protection_doctrine_v0.md` owns
publication and landing.

Default allowed work is documentation, decisions, prompts, reviews, migration
notes, and overlay maintenance. Implementation or runtime work requires
explicit bounded authorization in the current turn or an accepted handoff.

The canonical Forseti data lake root is `F:\forseti-data-lake`;
`forseti/product/spines/data_lake/authority/core_spine_v0_data_lake_physicality_location_contract_v0.md`
owns lake physicality and location semantics.
