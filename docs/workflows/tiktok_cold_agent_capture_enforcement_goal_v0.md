## Goal Establishing

Long-term goal: cold agents should be able to access and capture public TikTok creator/video/comment/subtitle evidence through the sanctioned Orca harness route without re-diagnosing known blockers, leaking secrets, or overclaiming source-access posture.

Anchor goal: convert the known TikTok cold-agent failure modes into deterministic runner/admission behavior where the machine can decide setup action, owner-attention, admissible capture, or fail-closed stop from flags and sanitized receipts.

Success signal:

- Core success:
  - Owner-observable: a cold agent can load one goal/playbook surface, run the sanctioned TikTok runner with a warmed dedicated session, and see a clear proceed/setup-click/owner-attention/admit/fail-closed outcome.
  - Output fit: future implementation batches should make fewer decisions depend on model memory; code should own mechanically checkable route, blocker, provenance, and admission gates.
  - Boundary: success is not a live capture guarantee, scale proof, account-safety proof, full-network no-proxy proof, CAPTCHA-solving authorization, or creator-registry promotion.
  - Drift cue: the work is drifting if it adds more prose reminders without moving a mechanically checkable blocker or admission rule into code.
- Secondary success signals:
  - The first controlled sessioned probe can resolve `chowdakr_sg_tiktok` to its machine-local CloakBrowser session mode and required harness proxy posture, then use named blocker actions and local `--admit-output` before any bronze write.
  - A failed close, unsupported subtitle host, missing provenance sidecar, or owner-attention condition stops with a typed reason that future agents can act on.

## Cold-Agent Operating Contract

If a future agent is asked to run TikTok capture, start here, then open the
playbook and runbook named in `open_next`. Do not reconstruct the route from
older handoffs.

Use the sanctioned one-fixture path:

1. Use `--session-profile chowdakr_sg_tiktok` with the TikTok
   one-creator live runner. The machine-local profile binds the dedicated
   auth-state label, configured session mode and required harness proxy posture,
   CloakBrowser, and pre-action owner handoff.
2. Run `check_source_capture_session_profile.py --session-profile
   chowdakr_sg_tiktok` when cold-start availability is uncertain. Missing,
   invalid, or provenance-mismatched profile state blocks before browser launch;
   never downgrade to logged-out capture.
3. Treat the bound required-posture value as harness proxy-profile
   posture only, not full-network no-proxy proof.
4. On a visible slider/captcha, prompt the owner before any scripted pointer
   action. Continue only after the marker clears; otherwise suppress scripted
   actions and fail closed. X/Close follow-through remains a separate explicit
   route and is not enabled by `chowdakr_sg_tiktok`. The runner never drags or
   solves slider/captcha puzzles.
5. Prefer local `--admit-output` first. Use explicit `--data-root` only when the
   owner asks for immediate bronze/data-lake admission.
6. Read `tiktok_live_probe_summary_json=` before opening larger JSON. It tells
   the cold agent whether the run stopped at staging, owner attention,
   fail-closed admission, local packet admission, or bronze admission.

Known blockers are not all terminal:

- intro/teaching/OK/Got-it/app prompts are benign setup actions;
- Retry/Try again/Reload is clicked once as setup;
- first-pass no-comments is not terminal until comments -> `You may like` /
  `More like this` -> comments has run, including the bounded repeat;
- `platform_challenge_observed` must be read with `matched_marker` and
  `challenge_kind`; an X-able slider/captcha may attempt only X/Close when
  follow-through is authorized;
- if slider/captcha remains, hand off to the owner when possible; otherwise fail
  closed. Owner/manual intervention is source-access intervention and never
  clean capture.

Code enforcement for BATCH-01 through BATCH-04 is implemented on PR #709 and
was cross-vendor reviewed in
`docs/review-outputs/tiktok_capture_enforcement_batches_1_4_post_adjudication_delegated_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`
with recommendation `keep` and `patches_applied: 0`. The review is decision
input, not validation, readiness, live TikTok success, account-safety proof,
full-network no-proxy proof, CAPTCHA bypass, scale proof, or merge authority.

## Code-Enforced Findings

These belong in deterministic runner, blocker-triage, provenance, receipt, test, or admission code. A cold agent should not need to remember them.

1. **Packet-grade TikTok route posture.** The sanctioned packet-grade route should be explicit and hard to misuse: `--browser-backend cloakbrowser` for TikTok live capture unless a diagnostic path is deliberately selected. `--browser-channel` must remain incompatible with CloakBrowser.
2. **Session provenance gate.** A sessioned run that requests posture must validate local auth-state sidecar provenance before browser launch. A label containing `noproxy` never clears the gate by itself.
3. **Harness proxy-posture vocabulary.** Code may require `no_proxy_profile_loaded` or `proxy_profile_loaded`; it must not expose that as full-network no-proxy proof.
4. **Secret scan.** Sidecars, packets, staging, receipts, docs, and admission payloads must reject raw cookies, storage-state contents, tokens, proxy endpoints, exit IPs, profile paths, device identifiers, and raw signed URLs.
5. **Benign overlay setup.** TikTok onboarding, teaching, `OK`, `Got it`, app, cookie, or continue-in-browser prompts without challenge/security markers are setup actions through named pointer actions, not terminal blockers.
6. **Visible retry setup.** `Retry`, `Retry again`, `Try again`, or `Reload` controls should be clicked once through a named pointer action before classifying failure.
7. **Comment route zero-yield.** `no_challenge_but_no_comments` is not terminal until the full comments -> `You may like` / `More like this` -> comments route has run, including the bounded second route pass when configured.
8. **Challenge breakdown.** `platform_challenge_observed` must break down into marker, kind, and receipt fields. Slider/captcha/security/auth-wall should not collapse into one undifferentiated stop string.
9. **X-able challenge follow-through.** When follow-through is authorized, code clicks only the modal X/Close through the named pointer-action substrate. It never drags or solves a puzzle.
10. **Close acceptance gate.** `clicked=true` means pointer delivery only. Admission requires close acceptance plus no final challenge/security triage marker. Failed close means zero admission even if comment traffic appears.
11. **Owner-attention state.** If a slider/captcha remains and manual solve is the only possible continuation, the runner should produce an owner-attention state or prompt when possible. If owner-attention/prompting is not available, it must fail closed with a typed reason rather than solving or pretending capture success.
12. **Human handoff receipt boundary.** Any owner/manual intervention is source-access intervention in receipts. It is not clean capture and must not silently satisfy clean-route assertions.
13. **Admission chaining.** Cold agents should use runner-owned `--admit-output` or explicit `--data-root` only. Hand-copying staging JSON into packets should remain out of the path.
14. **Admission fail-closed contract.** Nonzero challenge count, failures, first-failure reason, diagnostic close, challenge-close-as-success, captcha-solving markers, forbidden secret material, or missing source provenance when required must reject before packet/lake write.
15. **Subtitle/transcript capture.** Source-native captions should be captured only through explicit allowlisted subtitle hosts and sanitized WebVTT/cue payloads. Unsupported hosts should stop or mark a typed non-capture reason; raw signed subtitle URLs/bodies must not persist.
16. **Receipt inspectability.** The runner should preserve enough sanitized fields for a cold agent to classify: blocker class, matched marker, challenge kind, retry/benign/comment action chronology, close attempts, close accepted/not accepted, owner-attention state, admitted response count, DOM fallback count, subtitle status, provenance requirement status.

## Doctrine-Only Findings

These remain prose because they explain intent, risk, or interpretation rather than a deterministic runtime decision.

1. **Dedicated-account risk posture.** TikTok sessioned capture uses dedicated non-personal accounts and accepts burnable-account risk for that lane. The goal doc does not repeat human-login-only mechanics; agents already must not enter credentials.
2. **No full-network no-proxy claim.** `no_proxy_profile_loaded` means the harness did not load a proxy profile. It does not prove OS, VPN, corporate, ISP, or upstream egress state.
3. **Owner-attention preference.** If manual CAPTCHA/slider action becomes the only continuation, ping/hand off to the owner when possible; if not possible, fail closed. This is not permission to automate solving.
4. **Chrome connector boundary.** Owner Chrome may help observe UI and login state, but it is not packet-grade unless it can produce the same durable sanitized response receipts and no-secret guarantees.
5. **Playwright diagnostic boundary.** Playwright/Chrome can be used for explicit diagnostics, but it should not be the default TikTok capture route while CloakBrowser is the pinned working surface.
6. **Manual intervention interpretation.** Owner/manual solve can support source-access diagnosis or a clearly labeled intervention receipt; it is not unchallenged clean capture.
7. **One probe is not scale.** One successful fixture does not prove cross-creator durability, account safety, platform stability, or promotion readiness.
8. **Transcript interpretation.** TikTok subtitles are source-native subtitle evidence when present; not owner-generated ASR and not platform-wide transcript coverage.
9. **Bronze caution.** Prefer local `--admit-output` before data-lake `--data-root` unless the owner explicitly wants immediate bronze.

## Implementation Batches

Batches are intentionally materially large enough to reduce repeated cold-agent failures, but small enough to validate and review.

### BATCH-01 - Runner Posture, Provenance Preflight, And Owner-Attention Skeleton

Purpose: make the runner hard to invoke in the wrong TikTok capture posture and make pre-browser failures explicit.

Code scope:

- `forseti-harness/runners/run_source_capture_tiktok_live_batch_probe.py`
- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/live_batch_probe.py`
- `forseti-harness/source_capture/source_access_provenance.py` only if needed for exported helper messages
- focused tests in `forseti-harness/tests/unit/test_tiktok_live_batch_probe.py` and `forseti-harness/tests/unit/test_source_capture_authenticated_browser_snapshot.py`

Expected behavior:

- Resolve the machine-local `chowdakr_sg_tiktok` profile before browser launch; bind CloakBrowser, auth-state label, session mode, required proxy posture, and challenge policy without exposing secret paths or values.
- Keep a diagnostic route possible, but require explicit diagnostic intent when using non-CloakBrowser backend for TikTok.
- Fail closed with `BLOCKED_SESSION_PROFILE_UNAVAILABLE` for missing/invalid profile configuration or missing/legacy/mismatched auth-state provenance; never downgrade to logged-out capture.
- Prompt for owner attention at page load before scripted pointer actions. If the visible challenge does not clear, suppress those actions and preserve owner-attention/source-access-intervention receipt state.
- Preserve current no-solve/no-drag behavior, no-secret sidecar rules, and explicit-only X/Close follow-through.

Validation target:

- Unit tests that non-CloakBrowser packet-grade invocation is rejected or explicitly diagnostic.
- Unit tests that required harness proxy posture rejects before browser launch on legacy/missing/mismatched sidecar.
- Unit tests that owner-attention state is emitted/handled without classifying as clean capture.
- Existing provenance and live-runner tests remain green.

### BATCH-02 - Blocker State Machine And Low-Latency Setup Actions

Purpose: move the known cold-agent blocker taxonomy from memory/prose into deterministic triage and action sequencing.

Code scope:

- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/blocker_triage.py`
- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/live_batch_probe.py`
- pointer-action configs/tests in `forseti-harness/source_capture/adapters/browser_snapshot.py` only if missing
- focused tests in `forseti-harness/tests/unit/test_tiktok_live_batch_probe.py`, `forseti-harness/tests/unit/test_source_capture_browser_snapshot.py`, and blocker-triage tests

Expected behavior:

- Benign onboarding/teaching/OK/Got-it overlays trigger setup action, not terminal blocker.
- Visible Retry/Try again/Reload controls trigger exactly one setup retry action before failure.
- Comment route zero-yield requires the full bounded comment-tab route and repeat before terminal classification.
- Challenge classifier emits marker and `challenge_kind` instead of only `platform_challenge_observed`.
- X-able slider challenge attempts X/Close when authorized; failed close remains typed zero-admission stop.

Validation target:

- Fixture tests for each blocker class and action sequence.
- Receipt tests proving `pointer_action_chronology` contains setup actions and `comment_action` remains filtered to comment-route actions.
- Regression tests for `challenge_close_not_accepted` with zero admission.

### BATCH-03 - Admission, Receipt, And Transcript Enforcement

Purpose: make optional packet/bronze output reliable and ensure comments/subtitles are either admitted safely or rejected with typed reasons.

Code scope:

- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/batch_packet.py`
- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/admission.py`
- `forseti-harness/source_capture/tiktok/live_batch_probe.py`
- live runner admission chain
- tests for TikTok batch admission and live batch probe

Expected behavior:

- Admission rejects all challenge/failure/diagnostic/owner-manual-clean-claim violations before writing.
- Source-native subtitle allowlist and sanitized WebVTT/cue capture are explicit and tested.
- Unsupported subtitle host emits typed non-capture reason; raw signed URL/body never persists.
- Staging-to-packet receipts carry enough sanitized provenance to explain why a row did or did not admit.

Validation target:

- Batch admission rejection tests for every fail-closed marker.
- Subtitle allowlist tests and no-raw-url/no-raw-body tests.
- Local `--admit-output` success-path test for comment + subtitle-bearing fixture.

### BATCH-04 - Cold-Agent Command Surface And Probe Receipts

Purpose: make the operator-facing route simple enough that cold agents run the right command and stop after the right receipt.

Code/docs scope:

- runner `--help`
- `forseti-harness/README.md`
- `forseti-harness/docs/source_capture_agent_runbook.md`
- `docs/workflows/tiktok_ui_movement_blocker_substrate_playbook_v0.md`
- optional new receipt template/checker if needed

Expected behavior:

- The recommended one-fixture sessioned command is copyable and uses the code-enforced defaults/gates.
- The runner prints typed result summaries that distinguish staging, local admit-output, bronze data-root, owner-attention, and fail-closed.
- Docs remove stale ambiguity but do not claim validation, scale, or full-network no-proxy.

Validation target:

- `--help` snapshot/behavior tests where practical.
- DCP/header/handoff pointer gates if docs change.
- Post-batch review for BATCH-01..04 is filed at `docs/review-outputs/tiktok_capture_enforcement_batches_1_4_post_adjudication_delegated_adversarial_code_review_v0.md`; new code changes still require their own review routing.

## First Batch Assumption-Gate Target

Accepted direction for first gate: **BATCH-01 - Runner Posture, Provenance Preflight, And Owner-Attention Skeleton**.

Load-bearing assumptions to verify before implementation:

1. Current tests can exercise runner pre-browser exits without launching a real browser.
2. The live runner has a clean place to reject wrong backend/posture before calling `write_tiktok_live_batch_probe_outputs`.
3. Existing sidecar validators expose enough typed failure signals to distinguish missing/legacy/mismatch without printing secret-adjacent payloads.

If these are verified, BATCH-01 is the right first fused target. If not, route to a smaller preflight-only patch or a spec slice before implementation.

## Non-Claims

- This document is not validation, readiness, merge approval, PR acceptance, live capture success, or implementation completion.
- This document does not authorize CAPTCHA/slider solving or secret inspection.
- This document does not prove TikTok source access, account safety, subtitle coverage, bronze correctness, or scale.
- The batches are implementation targets; each still needs source reads, tests, and review routing under the Orca overlay.
