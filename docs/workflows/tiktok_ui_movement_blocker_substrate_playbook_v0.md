artifact_role: Workflow playbook
scope: >
  Cold-agent map for using Orca's bounded browser pointer-action substrate on
  TikTok logged-out and live-run UI blockers without converting challenge
  interaction into capture success.
use_when:
  - A TikTok logged-out limit-mapping lane needs to dismiss benign overlays
    while measuring public creator/video/comment access limits.
  - A TikTok live/sessioned lane hits benign overlays, comment-surface routing
    misses, slider/captcha close diagnostics, or visually present controls that
    are not exposed as DOM buttons.
  - A cold agent needs to know which UI movement action is allowed for each
    blocker class before running or patching the live probe.

```

## Core Rule

Use the shared pointer-action substrate for TikTok UI movement. Do not hand-roll
ad hoc Playwright clicks in a live lane unless the substrate itself is missing a
needed bounded capability and the patch adds tests plus a receipt.

Known targetability diagnostics are not useful work once pinned. The 2026-07-03
TikTok slider/challenge work produced three durable lessons future lanes must not
re-litigate:

- A benign TikTok teaching/scroll overlay is not the same blocker as the slider /
  captcha / security modal.
- `visual_fallback_geometric_target=true` is only a guessed coordinate; it is not
  proof that an X was detected or clicked. TikTok challenge-close actions must keep
  geometric fallback disabled.
- The latest authoritative live receipt proves a real DOM close target can be
  clicked (`target_kind=button`, `page_text_gate_matched=true`, `clicked=true`),
  but post-click visual candidates remained and the close was not accepted
  (`challenge_close_accepted=false`). Matched comment responses after failed close
  are diagnostic only; admitted count must stay zero.

Future lanes must spend run budget on accepted-close proof and real comment yield,
not on re-proving pointer delivery.


## 2026-07-04 Browser Surface Pin

Cold agents must not collapse all "Chrome" or "Playwright" routes into one
browser surface. The observed surfaces are materially different:

- The Codex Chrome connector can use the owner's existing Chrome profile and
  reached the Funmi fixture comments after the bounded
  comments -> `You may like` -> comments route. It is useful for observation and
  owner-visible diagnosis, but its read-only page scope is not packet-grade:
  it exposed `subtitleInfos` but did not expose `fetch`, and it must not inspect
  or persist cookies, tokens, auth state, raw signed subtitle URLs, or personal
  Chrome profile data.
- The current Playwright `--browser-channel chrome` route launches a new
  Playwright-controlled Chrome context. It is not the owner's already-open Chrome
  session. On 2026-07-04, the same Funmi route exposed the tab controls but
  ended with final `drag the slider` and zero visible comment bodies.
- A visible CloakBrowser route with `humanize=True` on the same fixture completed
  comments -> `You may like` -> comments with no final challenge/security marker
  and 12 visible comment-body nodes in the viewport.
- The post-patch runner receipt
  `tiktok_logged_out_cloakbrowser_probe_20260704_02` completed logged-out with
  `completed_count=1`, `challenge_count=0`, one admitted page-owned
  `/api/comment/list/` response, 20 assessed comments, no human handoff attempt,
  and no transcript capture because the subtitle host was rejected by the live
  probe allowlist.

Use this pin as routing evidence, not admission evidence. The runner surface is
`--browser-backend cloakbrowser`; do not combine it with `--browser-channel`.
For TikTok slider/captcha handoff, `--human-challenge-handoff` requires
`--allow-challenge-close-followthrough` and fires only after scripted X/Close
actions. Any manual solve is source-access intervention in the receipt, not
clean capture. This does not prove cross-creator durability, page-owned
`/api/comment/list` response capture, subtitle transcript capture across
creators, account safety at volume, or creator-registry promotion.

Current owner source-access redirect: for public TikTok content, an X-able
slider/captcha/security modal is no longer a hard capture blocker when the
current lane explicitly uses `--allow-challenge-close-followthrough`. The runner
may attempt the X/Close control, then attempt the page-owned comment route only
if post-click verification proves the close was accepted. `clicked=true` means
only that a pointer click was delivered; accepted follow-through requires
challenge/security text absence and centered visual-X absence on the action-level
after-click receipt, with `post_click_visual_target_absent=true` only when no
post-click visual X candidates remain. Final blocker triage must still report no
challenge/security marker. If final triage still sees `drag the slider`, `verify
to continue`, `captcha`, or equivalent challenge/security text,
`challenge_close_accepted=false` even when earlier click-delivery fields are true.
This is not CAPTCHA solving, not puzzle dragging, and not an unchallenged clean
route. It is an owner-authorized source-access intervention
that must be preserved in the receipt and batch payload. Continue only if the
rendered page no longer shows challenge/security text, the close receipt has
`challenge_close_accepted=true`, and either at least one page-owned
`/api/comment/list` response is captured or bounded DOM-visible comment
candidates are captured after the named comments -> `You may like` / `More
like this` -> comments route, including the bounded second route pass when the
first pass yields zero comments. DOM-visible comments are lower-tier `captured_visible_dom` evidence, not
page-owned response evidence; count-only/tab text such as `303`, `1.2K comments`,
`Comments`, or `Log in to comment` is not a comment body and cannot admit. If the
final visual close follow-through fails post-click verification, the pointer
sequence must stop before comment-route
actions; failed-close receipts must not carry `challenge_close_followthrough=true`
or label the close action as `comment_action`. A `visual_fallback_geometric_target=true`
receipt is a coordinate guess, not proof that an X was detected or clicked, and
must not be cited as X-click evidence. If the challenge marker remains,
close acceptance is false/missing, and neither response yield nor DOM-visible
comment yield is present, stop visibly. The older
`--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic` flag remains diagnosis-only and still forces
stop.

The substrate is:

- `BrowserPagePointerAction` in `orca-harness/source_capture/adapters/browser_snapshot.py`.
- `_run_pointer_action(...)` in the same file.
- Movement execution via `page.mouse.move(..., steps=...)` followed by
  `page.mouse.click(...)`, with randomized bounded target fractions and step
  counts from the action config.
- Sanitized receipts under `metadata.post_load_pointer_actions`; receipts must
  not include raw cookie/storage contents, raw endpoint URLs, or raw response
  bodies.

## Blocker Map

| Blocker / UI state | Action substrate | Allowed in clean run? | Success semantics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Benign TikTok onboarding/app prompt such as `Got it`, `OK`, `Not now`, `Continue in browser` | `tiktok_dismiss_benign_overlay_pointer_v0` | Yes | Setup action only; excluded from comment-action count; `OK` is matched as an exact button/control target, not as a broad page-text blocker marker. |
| Logged-out login upsell modal with a dismiss/close control and no challenge/security text | `tiktok_dismiss_benign_overlay_pointer_v0` or a named logged-out dismiss action if added later | Yes for logged-out limit mapping only | Setup action only; record the receipt and continue measuring public access. Do not enter credentials. |
| Comment surface does not load comments until tab shuffle | `comment_surface_toggle_pointer_sequence_v0`: `tiktok_open_comments_pointer_v0` -> `tiktok_open_more_like_this_pointer_v0` (`You may like` / `More like this`) -> `tiktok_reopen_comments_pointer_v0`, repeated once before zero-yield classification | Yes | Clean response-tier capture if at least one page-owned `/api/comment/list` response is admitted; lower-tier fallback if bounded DOM-visible comment candidates are captured after the route. First-pass zero response is not terminal; zero response and zero DOM-visible candidates after the repeated bounded route remains zero evidence, not success. |
| DOM-exposed slider/captcha close control | `tiktok_challenge_modal_close_followthrough_pointer_v0` for follow-through; `tiktok_challenge_modal_close_diagnostic_pointer_v0` for diagnosis | Yes only with `--allow-challenge-close-followthrough`; diagnostic flag remains stop-only | Attempt X/Close, do not solve/drag, then continue only if post-click verification plus final blocker triage accepts the close (`challenge_close_accepted=true`) and page-owned comments or DOM-visible comment candidates are captured; carry `source_access_intervention`. |
| Screenshot-visible but DOM-invisible slider/captcha X | `tiktok_challenge_modal_visual_close_followthrough_pointer_v0` for follow-through; `tiktok_challenge_modal_visual_close_diagnostic_pointer_v0` for diagnosis | Yes only with `--allow-challenge-close-followthrough`; diagnostic visual-X remains visible-challenge-text gated and stop-only | Follow-through visual-X may run before comment routing even when TikTok exposes the challenge marker only as hidden/residual DOM text. Continue only if post-click text/visual verification plus final blocker triage accepts the close and page-owned comments or DOM-visible comment candidates are captured, with the intervention preserved. |
| Slider/captcha puzzle itself | None | Never | Do not drag, solve, or attempt puzzle interaction. |
| Login/auth wall redirect, credential prompt, or account risk wall | None unless separately mapped as benign logged-out upsell | Never by default | Stop and report blocker. Do not enter credentials or manipulate account state. |
| Unknown dismiss/reload blocker | None until mapped | No | Stop or patch a named substrate action with tests; do not generic-click around blockers. |

Do not collapse TikTok's benign new-user education / scroll prompt into the
slider/captcha blocker class. A scroll/onboarding prompt is benign-overlay
dismissal when it has no challenge/security marker. The slider/captcha blocker
is the modal whose copy includes markers such as `Drag the slider to fit the
puzzle`; its only authorized follow-through target is the modal's internal
X/Close control, never the puzzle, browser tab, or browser/window close chrome.
TikTok challenge visual-X actions use the `center_modal` visual target zone so
they prefer the centered captcha modal close control over unrelated far
top-right page controls.
When no centered X component is detected, the same target zone may use a
bounded geometric center-modal close estimate and record
`visual_fallback_geometric_target=true`.

## Logged-Out Limit-Mapping Mode

Logged-out runs are allowed to measure TikTok's public creator/video/comment
surface limits before any sessioned retry. They must use the same pointer-action
substrate and receipts.

Allowed logged-out movement:

- dismiss benign onboarding, app, cookie, continue-in-browser, and login-upsell
  overlays when they expose a close/dismiss control and no challenge/security
  marker;
- open comments through the named comment-surface route action;
- capture public stats and comment bodies only through the armory runner/output
  path chosen for the lane, without pagination unless the current owner
  explicitly authorizes it.

Not allowed in logged-out capture:

- dragging, solving, or interacting with slider/captcha puzzles;
- treating a slider/captcha X click by itself as capture success;
- entering credentials, preserving auth state, or upgrading to a sessioned run
  without a fresh owner gate;
- repeating targetability diagnostics after the same challenge/security X has
  already been pinned.

If a logged-out run hits a closeable login upsell, dismiss once and continue. If
it hits an X-able public slider/captcha/security modal and the current owner has
authorized follow-through, use `--allow-challenge-close-followthrough` once and
continue only when `challenge_close_accepted=true` includes no final challenge/security
triage marker and there is post-close page-owned comment response yield or DOM-visible
comment candidate yield. If
follow-through is not authorized, if close acceptance is unproven, or if the
challenge remains after the close click, stop and record the blocker state. Do
not run a close diagnostic merely to re-prove X targetability.

## Cold-Agent Blocker Taxonomy

Use these classes before naming a TikTok state as a stop condition:

- `benign_overlay`: teaching, scroll, app, cookie, `OK`, `Got it`, `Not now`, or
  continue-in-browser prompts with no challenge/security marker. Use
  `tiktok_dismiss_benign_overlay_pointer_v0`; this is setup, not admission.
- `retry_visible_error`: visible `Retry`, `Retry again`, `Try again`, or `Reload`
  controls. Use `tiktok_retry_visible_error_pointer_v0` once before treating the
  page as failed; this is setup, not admission.
- `comment_route_zero_yield`: no admitted page-owned comment response and no
  DOM-visible comment-body candidate after the full bounded route. This is only
  valid after the runner has attempted comments -> `You may like` / `More like
  this` -> comments, repeated once. A first zero response is not terminal.
- `challenge_or_security`: visible or final-triage challenge/security text such
  as `drag the slider`, `verify to continue`, `captcha`, or `security check`.
  If follow-through is owner-authorized, click only the X/Close control through
  the named pointer-action substrate. Never drag or solve the puzzle.
- `challenge_close_not_accepted`: an X/Close pointer click was delivered, but
  post-click visual candidates remain, challenge/security text remains, or final
  triage still sees the challenge. This is a real stop with zero admission even
  when a `/api/comment/list` response was observed.
- `login_or_auth_wall`: login redirect, credential prompt, account-risk wall, or
  auth wall. Stop unless a separate owner-gated sessioned lane has been loaded;
  never enter credentials in this lane.

For classification, do not stop at the top-level reason string. Inspect
`blocker_triage.blocker_class`, `matched_marker`, `challenge_kind`,
`comment_action.sequence_name`, `comment_action.action_sequence[*].action_name`,
`pointer_action_chronology[*].action_name`, `challenge_close_attempts[*]`, and the post-click visual counts (`post_click_visual_candidate_count`, `post_click_visual_zone_candidate_count`) when present.
`platform_challenge_observed` must break down into at least marker and kind;
`drag the slider` maps to `challenge_kind=slider`. The filtered
`comment_action` field intentionally omits retry, benign overlay, and
challenge-close actions; use `pointer_action_chronology` for exact chronology.

## Cold-Agent Procedure

1. Load the active handoff and this playbook. Re-read the current
   `browser_snapshot.py`, `live_batch_probe.py`, and `blocker_triage.py` before
   making strict claims.
2. Select mode before browser action:
   - logged-out limit mapping: no auth state, no credential entry, benign
     dismissals allowed, challenge/security stops;
   - live/sessioned gate: dedicated non-personal warmed account,
     human-performed login, authorized auth-state label/session mode, no
     duplicate TikTok tabs, and owner authorization for the live run.
3. For an unchallenged route-yield gate, run without challenge-close flags. The
   runner may press visible retry controls, dismiss benign overlays, and perform
   comments -> `You may like` / `More like this` -> comments twice before
   treating zero response plus zero DOM-visible candidates as zero evidence.
4. If the current owner authorizes X-able challenge follow-through, run with
   `--allow-challenge-close-followthrough`. The runner uses only named pointer
   actions: it attempts challenge X/Close controls and the bounded comments ->
   `You may like` / `More like this` -> comments route, with close attempts
   interleaved after route clicks when configured. Continue only if the first
   video has `completed_count=1`, `challenge_count=0`, no failures, and either
   `admitted_comment_response_count >= 1` or
   `dom_visible_comment_candidate_count >= 1`. Any close action must be
   preserved as `challenge_close_action` / `source_access_intervention`.
5. If the owner explicitly authorizes challenge-close diagnosis instead, run with
   `--allow-challenge-close-diagnostic`. A DOM close click or visual-X close click
   must stop the run and must not admit, expand, or claim capture success. The
   diagnostic path is retained only for changed-condition checks.
6. Scan outputs for forbidden markers before any admission claim. Auth-state files
   copied for a live run must be removed and verified absent after the run.
   Batch admission is code-gated to reject challenge/diagnostic cadence: nonzero
   `challenge_count`, non-empty `failures`, `first_failure_reason`,
   `captcha_solving=true`, `challenge_close_counts_as_success=true`, or
   `challenge_close_diagnostic_allowed=true` cannot be admitted.

## Receipt Fields To Inspect

For benign overlay:

- `capture_receipt.benign_overlay_action.action_name`
- `target_found`, `clicked`, `candidate_count`, `matched_count`, `wait_ms`

For comment routing:

- `pointer_action_chronology[*].action_name=tiktok_retry_visible_error_pointer_v0` when a visible retry control was clicked
- `capture_receipt.comment_action.sequence_name`
- `action_count`
- `action_sequence[*].action_name`
- `clicked_all_targets`
- `admitted_comment_response_count`
- `dom_visible_comment_candidate_count`
- `comment_capture_fallback`

For challenge-close diagnostics:

- `capture_receipt.challenge_close_action.action_name` for follow-through rows
- `blocker_triage.challenge_close_diagnostic.action_name` for diagnostic stops
- `target_found`, `clicked`, `target_kind`, `selection_strategy`
- visual-only fields: `visual_fallback_attempted`,
  `visual_fallback_target_found`, `visual_fallback_candidate_count`,
  `visual_fallback_zone_candidate_count`, `visual_fallback_confidence`,
  `visual_fallback_crop_box`,
  `visual_fallback_screenshot_sha256`, `visual_fallback_target_zone`,
  `visual_fallback_geometric_target`,
  `target_box`, `click_point`
- close-acceptance fields: `challenge_close_accepted`,
  `post_click_absence_verified`, `post_click_absence_matched_marker`,
  `post_click_visual_target_absent`, `post_click_visual_candidate_count`,
  `post_click_visual_zone_candidate_count`, `post_click_visual_screenshot_sha256`

A clicked diagnostic receipt is evidence that a pointer click was delivered to a
candidate close target; it is not capture success and does not prove the modal
closed. A follow-through receipt is admissible only when the action-level post-click
checks satisfy the current close-acceptance predicate (`challenge_close_accepted=true`)
and final blocker triage still reports no challenge/security marker. The zone
candidate counts are diagnostic: `post_click_visual_zone_candidate_count=0` can
show the centered modal X disappeared, but it does not override
`post_click_visual_target_absent=false` or a final `drag the slider` marker.
The capture claim then comes only from post-close page-owned comment response
evidence or lower-tier DOM-visible comment fallback evidence in the sanitized
admission payload. For the current TikTok slider/challenge X, close-targeting is
already pinned and should not be re-diagnosed; close acceptance is the material
receipt field.

## Patch Rule For New Blockers

If a new blocker needs UI movement:

1. Add a named `BrowserPagePointerAction` config, not an inline click.
2. Gate it by visible page text or by an explicit diagnostic flag when it touches
   challenge/auth-risk UI.
3. Preserve sanitized receipt fields that explain what was attempted and why.
4. Add unit tests in `test_source_capture_browser_snapshot.py` for substrate
   behavior and `test_tiktok_live_batch_probe.py` for TikTok ordering/stop
   semantics.
5. Update this playbook and the active handoff.

Never add a path where closing or dismissing a challenge can produce a completed
capture row, admission, batch expansion, product extraction, or success claim.

    TikTok challenge-close acceptance now fails closed when final blocker triage
    still sees challenge/security text, even if the action-level immediate
