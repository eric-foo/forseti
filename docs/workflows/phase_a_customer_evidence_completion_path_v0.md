# Phase A customer-evidence completion path v0

Before proposing or testing a consolidation-method optimization, read
[Supported operating route and owner-only reopen boundary](../../forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_contract_v0.md#supported-operating-route-and-owner-only-reopen-boundary).
That section owns the supported method and deferred alternatives; experimental
code below or in the harness does not change their status. The transition check
is owned by `.agents/workflow-overlay/decision-routing.md`.

## Purpose

This is the durable path from a captured customer corpus to a complete,
retrievable evidence structure. It prevents a future operator from stopping
after two or three convenient examples or from treating Reddit and retailer
reviews as unrelated summaries. It does not produce a market conclusion.

**Collection** ends by emitting the existing hash-bound
`semantic_evidence_source_v3` and its matching
`phase_a_semantic_materialization_receipt_v1`. Collection owns locator and
source-artifact hash checks, normalization, denominator and product binding,
and materialization. The materialized source is the complete consumer input;
the receipt preserves its Collection lineage without becoming another
Consolidation command argument.

For collection's stopping decision, follow the provisional interpretation and
scan loop in the [acquisition playbook](../../forseti/product/spines/commission_signal_board/workflows/commission_signal_board_playbook_v0.md).
A materialized source or a successful source repair establishes an input, not
material saturation or a fresh need for acquisition. That loop reassesses the
affected evidence before choosing more collection; it does not wait for the
final Evidence Consolidation output described below.

Semantic leaf assessment, atomic evidence structuring, meaning-based
reconciliation, and evidence-packet projection together form the named
**Evidence Consolidation** stage. It begins from Collection's immutable,
completely accounted materialized source and ends only when the final corpus
hash has a complete, reproducible evidence packet or a visible unresolved
failure. The public preparation runner verifies the source's stored content
hash without reopening its provenance locators. Current selection consumers
also keep missing publication times unavailable rather than reopening those
Collection paths. Historical unmaterialized inputs and bundles without a
materialized-source identity keep their existing locator behavior. New selection
manifest v2 and no-frontier axis manifest v3 bind the portable behavior.
Historical selection v1 and no-frontier manifest v2 replay either pre-existing
date projection only against their complete original inventory hash; the legacy
projection verifies its source-artifact bytes. Never restamp a frozen inventory
to bypass a date mismatch. Contract v119 owns this compatibility boundary.
This is a conceptual and completion boundary between acquisition and Deliver,
not a new globally numbered phase: historical Phase A, Phase B, Turn B,
Understanding, and Deliver vocabulary is not renumbered or migrated.

For new cross-company authoring, use `phase_a_semantic_integration_run_v11`
(integration method v13, verifier v12). The supplied `CURRENT_AXES` inventory
owns output IDs; shared examples describe concepts, never another company's
required IDs. Preserve a supported meaning even when it needs an emerging-axis
label instead of an existing axis. See the semantic-integration contract v81
for the owning rule. Contract v122 adds meaning-boundary guidance to the existing
producer and verifier and versions new Decision State prompts as manifest v2;
old v1 manifests retain their original batching prompts. Historical run v10 /
method v12 and earlier artifacts keep
their original identity and replay; do not edit frozen outputs or relabel old
responses as a new-method proof. This correction does not establish the cause
of Dieux's provider timeout. All new model attempts use `high` under the
operator rule in `docs/decisions/subagent_model_tiering_doctrine_v0.md`.

Current reconciliation preserves child condition strings verbatim and asks
for one genuinely shared bounded meaning per merge, not a broad bucket of
different outcomes or behavior states. Shared product IDs alone do not prove
equivalent scope. Contract v81 owns this clarification; the existing literal
condition and lineage validators remain unchanged. The model also receives
the original source roles by relation and the compiler's existing claim-kind
competence table; an echoed factual statement cannot silently become a
directly verified fact. A failed reconciliation
answer remains preserved, and a corrected prompt uses a fresh attempt over
the same verified compilation without repeating extraction or verification.
This is not a semantic-truth guarantee or a full-corpus completion claim.

Whole-row verification and selective repair attach each decision by its explicit
evidence ID, not response-list position. Every assigned row must occur exactly
once; missing, duplicate, foreign, and mismatched replacement identities fail.
Application preserves source order and raw response hashes preserve the actual
answer order. Contract v82 owns this boundary; it changes no semantic prompt or
stage identity and does not make a structurally valid answer semantically right.

Frozen verifier-v8 compilations replay unchanged where the current verifier is
v9, whose change was response transport only. New verification still uses v9;
methods v11/v12/v13 retain their stricter verifier pairing. The semantic-integration
contract's v77 replay clarification owns the exact version/hash acceptance and
unchanged active-row/lineage checks. Replay does not establish current-method
execution or semantic truth and requires no provider re-verification merely to
change a version label.

The existing calibration entry point follows the production-owned
`SEMANTIC_METHODS_V7_PLUS` set, including current method v13, rather than a
separate historical allowlist. Primary and cold-repeat evaluation both require
their own exact row-verified compilation for those methods. Contract v79 owns
this compatibility correction; it neither changes semantic prompts nor makes
a prepared calibration slice a passing readiness proof.

The public saved-prompt loader retains the producer-derived response-schema
metadata and checks the actual saved prompt text; it does not reconstruct over
an altered saved prompt. Method v12 removes the inherited instruction to delete
explicit overall evaluations, which conflicted with whole-row preservation.
Verifier v11 makes acceptance contingent on checking each meaning, logical
direction, qualification, and explicit reason-to-behavior link. This reuses the
existing extraction and verification stages; it adds no model call or semantic
classifier. The corrected policy still requires source-authored calibration,
cold-repeat agreement, and final-view evidence. Its availability is not a
semantic accuracy, reader-quality, or Dieux completion claim.

## Before changing Phase A evidence machinery

Use these regression anchors before changing the Phase A point-pack, selection,
quote, or axis-projection machinery. They name the active boundaries most likely
to produce a plausible but misleading result if lost. This section is a retrieval and
regression aid, not evidence authority, schema authority, or an exhaustive
changelog. The linked contracts and executable tests own the current meaning;
superseded rationale remains in the [semantic-integration changelog](../../forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog)
and in Git/PR history. Update an anchor only when its active
boundary or enforcement moves; do not append a row for every PR.

Choose the cheapest proof that reaches the affected consumer boundary. For a
change to reconstructed hash-bound bytes, replay an independently produced
historical artifact with the current consumer: the change must preserve its
stamped bytes. Behavior that must differ belongs behind a new schema version
while the old consumer path remains replayable. A new version never retires the
old replay. Do not generate the historical baseline with the code under test: a
producer emulated inside the same run proves the old consumer path still
finalizes, which is weaker than byte preservation and must be cited as the
weaker claim. For a change to meaning, routing, or counting, use one minimal
wrong-cause fixture that passes earlier identity and shape guards before failing
at the intended semantic boundary; for that fixture only, run the targeted red,
then its green and one unaffected control. A guidance-only change that alters
none of meaning, routing, counting, or stamped bytes owes no new behavior test.
Use cold model dogfood only when reader-facing meaning, ordering, or emphasis
could materially change the judgment formed from the same evidence, and owe it
whenever that boundary is crossed; reserve a full axis or mirrored comparison
for a material consumer-quality question. A deterministic compatibility change
does not owe a provider rerun or full-axis model dogfood. Every change still
runs its affected focused checks once and required CI once.

| Current Decision State authoring reuses an old judgment only when the evidence ID, semantic-unit ref, literal normalized statement, axes, conditions, and polarity are unchanged and every prior observation gives the same complete state bundle; only new, changed, partial, or conflicting meanings return to bounded judgment. Oversized delta work is packed by whole evidence group under an explicit character ceiling and recombined only with exact batch-local and full-manifest coverage. | A rebuild copies states by point or row position, so regrouping the same evidence transfers a correct-looking state to the wrong meaning; every rebuild pays to re-judge already settled evidence; or one all-axis request exceeds the provider entry limit or silently drops an overflow group. | This workflow, paragraph beginning `When current packs regroup`; `phase_a_decision_state_reconciliation.py`; runner commands `prepare-decision-state-reconciliation`, `prepare-decision-state-adjudication-batches`, `combine-decision-state-adjudication-batches`, and `finalize-decision-state-reconciliation`; axis tests beginning `test_decision_state_reconciliation_`. | [Semantic-integration history](../../forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog) `v67` and `v112`. The manifest is run-scoped, not a global registry, and historical agreement proves reuse eligibility rather than semantic truth. |
| A current literal-frontier point takes its axis membership from the exact hash-bound packet proposition, while every selected evidence row remains attached to its own source-native axis tags. Historical sparse manifests still require the conservative all-row match. | One valid multi-axis finding is rejected from an axis merely because its evidence rows divide the finding's axes among themselves, or an unbound axis is admitted by a loose row tag. | `_literal_frontier_axis_is_bound` in `phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py`; axis tests `test_current_frontier_point_axis_binding_allows_split_candidate_axis_tags` and `test_axis_pack_rejects_foreign_axis_candidate`. | [Semantic-integration history](../../forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog) `v112`; packet proposition identity remains the authority and no row tag, relation, or frozen artifact is rewritten. |
| Price concern, value rejection or approval, and source-supported premium quality/positioning remain separate; Phase A does not infer pricing power or a higher-tier recommendation. | "Expensive but worth it" is flattened into poor value, or the word `premium` is invented from price and handed downstream as a recommendation. | This workflow, paragraph beginning `For price-and-value evidence`; `DECISION_STATE_BOUNDARIES` in `forseti-harness/judgment/phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py`; `VALUE_RELATION_GUIDANCE`, `_uses_value_policy`, and `_select_value_groups` in `forseti-harness/judgment/phase_a_evidence_selection.py`; axis test `test_decision_state_keeps_price_value_and_premium_meanings_distinct`; selection tests `test_high_spend_buyer_remorse_cannot_be_promoted_to_value_support` and `test_value_policy_does_not_turn_time_to_finish_into_quantity_value`. | [Semantic-integration history](../../forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_semantic_evidence_integration_changelog_v0.md#changelog) `v40`, `v45`, `v46`, and `v48`; commits `5529a646`, `ef791055`; PR [#1513](https://github.com/eric-foo/forseti/pull/1513). |

| A cold model reads routed v2 evidence through a hash-bound manifest plus one point-local JSONL file containing self-contained displayed facts; route-specific meaning remains inside each fact. | A normalized view or one axis-wide fact stream forces repeated joins or searches, so reading cost becomes unstable or a quote, date, relation, companion meaning, or Decision State is transferred across points. | This workflow, paragraph beginning `When a cold model must read`; `build_axis_reader_bundle` and `validate_axis_reader_bundle` in `forseti-harness/judgment/phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py`; axis tests `test_axis_reader_bundle_keeps_complete_direct_outcome_facts_local`, `test_axis_reader_bundle_keeps_decision_state_and_mixed_routes_distinct`, and `test_axis_reader_bundle_wrong_cause_reaches_reprojection_boundary`. | The landing revision and review disposition are preserved in Git history; no frozen consolidated-view bytes are changed. |

## Active commercial point-entry boundary

For the completed Summer Fridays Phase A packet, the business question is:
**Which customer-valued strengths and objections deserve commercial
investigation?** The no-provider
`build-customer-pull-point-frontier` command accounts every proposition matching
the requested product subject in one of three places:

- `retailer_first_queue` is read first because a retailer review is closest to
  a completed purchase;
- `community_discovery_queue` keeps customer points found only in community or
  qualified audience evidence visible and records retailer check-back as still
  open; and
- `nonpromoted_points` records why a proposition did not earn investigation.

The frontier also records every proposition excluded by the requested product
subject and reports the input, matched, and filtered counts. A stale or mistyped
subject therefore cannot make a smaller frontier look like complete packet
accounting.

Retailer is a first-look venue, never an admission gate. A community-only
purchase, repurchase, recommendation, recurring experience, or materially
engaged customer point may earn investigation without retailer support. It
does not become retailer corroboration. Conversely, creator-authored material
remains influence context and cannot enter either customer-truth queue.
Engagement is retained and ordered only within its own venue, role, and metric;
the frontier has no cross-platform customer-pull score.

Within each queue, more independent supporting origins lead. When origin counts
tie, cross-role independent recurrence leads same-role recurrence, followed by
more materially engaged supporting evidence items. Reported behavior remains a
commercially useful final tie-breaker, but generic trial or ownership does not
automatically outrank a better-corroborated strength or objection. This is a
queue-specific investigation order, not a universal source-quality ranking.
Materially engaged items may share one origin; they add resonance context but
do not add independent recurrence. An unavailable engagement posture adds no
materiality. Operator protection keeps a safety or costly-behavior point
admitted and accounted, but protection alone grants no ordering priority.

The frontier is a navigation artifact over a complete, non-truncated
`phase_a_evidence_packet_v3`; it is not packet v4 or a new evidence authority.
`materialize-customer-pull-point-selection-spec` turns one admitted proposition
into one hash-bound bounded-point selection with the normal thirteen-truth-origin
cap. For a non-value point with an explicit axis, candidate admission is the
union of every semantic row for the same product and axis plus the proposition's
literal refs. Every admitted row is judged against the exact bounded
point; sharing an axis grants no support or counter relation. Value points keep
literal-ref admission because their price/value behavior policy is not the
generic non-value route, and a hand-built value-first spec cannot claim the
non-value recent-year selection policy. The full packet and every frontier disposition remain
available; the displayed pack never implies prevalence.

That exact-point judgment includes every material qualifier. Ordinary,
possible, quick, or qualified drying is adjacent to a severe-drying point, as
is a severe reaction or consequence that the source does not explicitly link
to drying. Likewise, similar symptoms are adjacent to a same-experience point
unless the candidate or its exact linked parent supplies an explicit comparison
or adoption target. This boundary is enforced in both initial relation judgment
and pre-selection confirmation; display selection cannot repair it later.
Support and counter must also preserve the bounded point's exact state,
predicate, scope, and load-bearing actor identity rather than merely matching a
favorable or unfavorable direction. A different actor's private judgment,
intent, ownership, or behavior cannot prove or disprove a named actor's private
state unless the point itself explicitly asserts a cross-actor pattern.
Ownership needs explicit possession or acquisition; liking, future purchase, or
an incomplete owned-shade list does not establish or negate it. Likewise,
repurchasing when a product runs out is not an aim to finish: completion intent
needs an explicit goal, plan, aim, or commitment to finish, use up, or pan the
item. Superlatives require an equivalent superlative over the same assortment
and attribute scope. Other materially overlapping states are adjacent; sharing
only a product family or axis is excluded. These boundaries apply in the first
relation pass and every confirmation route.

Frontier specs use the exact bounded point as their direction: evidence that
the balm is expensive supports that objection, rather than being reversed by
the older positive-good-value box policy. Historical value-box selections keep
their stamped policy.

Fresh selections use `phase_a_evidence_selection_spec_v2` and explicitly author
`point_actor_scope`. This is part of the point's meaning, not a relation label:
`{"mode":"source_local_reports"}` makes an unqualified author/customer/reviewer
refer separately to each reporting origin; `identified_actor` additionally
requires `source_id` and `independence_key` resolving to a credited literal
point anchor. `source_id` identifies an input source that may contain many
actors; it is not a person identifier. Read the source-bound `independence_key`
together with `independence_posture` and source-visible attribution. Different
keys alone do not prove different people; unavailable identity and possible
overlap remain unresolved. Never choose a focal person from row order or an
opaque ref.
Do not silently use source-local reporting to broaden an explicitly named
person's claim. Scope choice and semantic fit remain judgment-owned.

The existing initial and confirmation requests carry that scope and each row's
source-owned origin identity. For source-local reports, opposing favorite
choices can be contrasting reports, never proof that another person's private
favorite is false. Check origin overlap before calling opposed rows separate
authors: one credited origin can appear on both sides. Preserve its separate
observations; conflict, change, or refinement depends on meanings and dates,
not identity alone. A joint favorite does not oppose a non-exclusive favorite
claim merely because another option is named; preserve any explicit exclusivity
criterion. Ownership of another option or an incomplete owned-option
list does not negate ownership. For an identified actor, a foreign or unknown
origin cannot receive support/counter for that actor's private state; the
identity boundary rejects such labels without guessing what prose means.
Within a current point, repeated identical source/evidence/ref-set bindings
must carry the same relation, even when different primary rows carry them.
The existing authoring and consumer checks reject a conflict; they do not
choose the right relation. Historical unscoped replay is not reinterpreted.

An explicit bounded adjudication may settle a repeated exact-binding conflict.
Attach it once to the current point spec as an inline `relation_adjudication`
record. Current `phase_a_relation_adjudication_v2` contains
`schema_version`, `basis_sha256`, and nonempty `decisions`. Compute the basis
with `phase_a_evidence_selection.relation_adjudication_basis(manifest,
candidates)` over the verified current selection and its complete candidate
inventory. Each authored decision carries `source_id`, `evidence_id`, the
exact nonempty prior and replacement `relation_semantic_unit_refs`, `relation`,
`reason_code`, and a source-backed `rationale`. The prior set locates one exact
confirmed binding, which may occur on multiple confirmed candidate rows; both
sets must be nonempty and owned by the same evidence row. V1 remains replayable
and uses its one ref set only as the locator, leaving the confirmed refs
unchanged. This is an explicit judgment input, not a provider
answer, self-certifying approval field, or automatic preference for an older
label. A changed point/spec, source file, candidate inventory, or judging policy
invalidates the basis and requires renewed judgment; do not merely rehash it.
Judging policy includes the fields projected to both relation stages; row order
and batching alone do not invalidate the record. Only the inline correction is
excluded from the basis to avoid a cycle. Because the record travels inside the
spec, replay does not depend on an authoring machine's filesystem.

Both existing preselection finalizers apply the authored relation and reason
to every confirmed row with that exact source/evidence/ref-set binding. V2 also
applies the authored replacement refs; V1 leaves the confirmed refs unchanged.
The finalizers do not independently choose either set. Unmatched or duplicate
decisions fail visibly; all other rows retain their provider answers and the
consistency guard remains active. Raw provider responses remain in replay, and
the confirmation receipt records the embedded correction, every changed
candidate and prior label, and the mechanically-unproven semantic warrant. The
quote consumer revalidates the same binding. Historical unscoped specs and
pre-confirmation routes cannot accept this extension. No default correction,
global judgment cache, extra provider call, or mandatory review ceremony is
introduced. This exception path does not remove the existing semantic workload
for a genuinely fresh selection.

The scope survives unchanged into the point artifact, consolidated view,
structured reader, point-reader request, and compiled brief. Missing or changed
scope fails locally. The point snapshot freezes the scope-reading rule and
binds its hash into scoped point inputs; changing that rule invalidates only
those readings, not unscoped historical points. Mixed reader tables show absent
historical scope as null without assigning it a new meaning.
`materialize-customer-pull-point-selection-spec` takes the
authored JSON through `--point-actor-scope`; both fresh preparation commands
require v2. Frozen v1 selection manifests retain their original finalization
and reader replay, without a fabricated scope or frozen-byte migration.

This adds one explicit choice to authoring and linear identity checks, not a
provider stage, per-point whole-axis reread, automatic semantic classifier, or
proof of semantic truth. The 2026-08-29 shade diagnosis found different people
grouped under unqualified `the author` wording while confirmation invented a
same/different focal-actor distinction. Correct attachment alone cannot resolve
that missing scope; old comparison wins do not clear it.

For a new point pack, relation confirmation occurs before the display cap:

```text
prepare-evidence-selection
  -> external first relation response over every admitted row
  -> prepare-preselection-relation-confirmation
  -> external hidden-label confirmation over every material, protected, or
     influence row that could reach display
  -> finalize-preselection-relation-confirmation-full-source
     (deterministically copies each selected row's complete bound source body)
```

For complete literal-frontier points as well as historical expanded non-value
axis pools, use the named batch route at both model boundaries when needed:

```text
prepare-evidence-selection-batches
  -> external named relation responses over every admitted row
  -> prepare-batched-preselection-relation-confirmation
  -> external named hidden-label confirmation responses over every material,
     protected, or influence row that could reach display
  -> finalize-batched-preselection-relation-confirmation-full-source
     (deterministically copies each selected row's complete bound source body)
```

Both batch manifests bind contiguous complete row coverage and each response's
own batch identity. Batching is transport only: it changes neither candidate
admission nor the source-bound origin count. Both preparation commands default
`--max-request-bytes` to 50000 for the actual UTF-8 prompt plus compact response
schema; `--batch-size` separately bounds required row decisions. Prepare the
whole current stage before launching its calls. Preparation splits the complete
inventory and rejects a single row that cannot fit, without truncation. Prepare
confirmation the same way once its required first-pass decisions exist; it is
not valid to bound only the first pass. This is not a response-token estimate or
a guarantee about hidden service context. Finalize the complete confirmations
through the native full-source reader before claiming the point is complete.

When calls may run concurrently or be retried and their individual outputs or
token use matter to the run's proof, each call is an immutable attempt. Before
launching it, choose a new attempt ID and new attempt directory; refuse the
launch if that directory or any intended response, event-log, or usage-receipt
target already exists. Persist the structured response, complete event stream,
and exact usage record under that one attempt ID before the attempt may be
selected as the canonical response. A retry uses a new attempt ID. It may
supersede an earlier attempt for finalization, but it never overwrites, renames
onto, or deletes the earlier attempt. All-attempt accounting includes every
launched attempt in that proof, including discarded successes and failures. If
any launched attempt lacks a recoverable exact usage record, the all-attempt
token proof is `FAIL_UNOBSERVED`; do not estimate the missing usage from another
call or report only the chosen canonical calls as the complete run cost. Serial
calls whose individual attempt history is not used in a comparison or proof do
not acquire this extra bookkeeping merely for uniformity.

Use `reserve-evidence-selection-provider-attempt --attempt-root <root>
--attempt-id <new-id>` before each call. Send `codex exec -o` to the returned
`response.json` and its `--json` output to the returned `events.jsonl`; never
send either stream directly to a canonical batch-response path. After the call,
use `publish-evidence-selection-provider-attempt --attempt-dir <attempt>
--response-dir <canonical-dir> --canonical-response-name <name>`. For a named
relation batch also supply `--batch-manifest` and `--batch-id`; publication then
validates the batch-bound response, extracts and preserves the exact completed-
turn usage, and atomically hard-links the response without replacement. Keep
every attempt directory after publication or failure.

A completed structured answer stranded inside a timed-out attempt is not a
normal publication success. For reconciliation only, use
`recover-reconciliation-provider-attempt` with the exact bundle, immutable
stage, stored batch schema, every candidate attempt directory, and a new
recovery directory. The route verifies both execution receipts; the bound
prompt, schema, events, stderr, and optional response hashes; one distinct
completed `agent_message`; strict JSON object decoding that rejects non-finite
constants; LF-delimited JSONL that preserves Unicode separators inside string
values; the stored response schema; and the unchanged stage-native consumer. Exact identical
retransmissions inside one attempt may collapse. Across eligible retries the
earliest bound `started_at` UTC instant wins without comparing answer meaning
or quality; canonical whole-second and fractional-second timestamps are both
ordered by parsed time rather than their text representation.
Zero messages, multiple distinct messages, partial or malformed JSON, changed
hashes, schema or native rejection, and non-timeout outcomes remain rejected.
The route writes new no-replace response and recovery-receipt artifacts, never
changes the attempt, never relabels its `TIMED_OUT` outcome, makes no provider
call, and records missing completed-turn usage as `UNOBSERVED` rather than
estimating it. Normal publication remains unchanged and still refuses timed-out
attempts.

Whole-row verification and repair preparation for current keyed-v3 methods v10,
v11 and v12 emits response v2 with one required answer slot per assigned evidence ID. Use the
public preparation runner's accompanying `.schema.json` as the provider output
schema, not an array-length-only substitute. Native consumers still enforce
exact coverage and replacement ownership. Explicit library-level v1 prompt
replay and stored v1 responses remain supported; the source-work stage is unchanged, so accepted
answers are not regenerated merely to adopt keyed transport. Correct row
participation does not establish correct interpretation.

Current method-v12 reconciliation preparation persists decision-only response
v3's schema beside every prompt. Every candidate has one required decision slot
(one or more node attachments, or an allowed unmerged reason); every original
emerging label has one required group-assignment slot. Normal-mode admitted
customer findings cannot be unmerged: an uncertain finding may remain a
nonterminal singleton. The model owns grouping, relations, bounded wording,
axes and claim/uncertainty metadata. Code carries exact compatible product,
comparator and version identities, literal child-owned conditions, original
emerging labels, polarity composition and lineage. It never authors a missing
decision or definition; explicit model-authored completion is separate below.
Native consumers reject missing, foreign,
duplicate, orphan or prohibited assignments, and incompatible identities.
Structural exactness does not establish semantic warrant.
Normal method-v12 response-v3 requests at `prepare-reconciliation-level` select
`exact_identity_namespaces_v4`: each exact subject/comparator/version set tuple
gets an opaque prefix and each candidate may attach only to keys in its own
class. Compatible evidence may share any number of model-authored keys; matching
identity does not justify merging meanings. The same rule applies at later
levels and in convergence. The native one-leaf/one-child-path rule is exposed
through exact shared-leaf groups, and fresh current batches cap at 96 candidates so output and connected
repair scope remain bounded without truncation. It adds request bytes, not
another provider stage. V4 adds the shared supported-meaning standard: form a
useful assertion each support establishes without inventing a stronger status
label or threshold. Current selection manifest v3 applies that standard when
interpreting the fixed claim; it does not broaden the claim or relax source facts.
New packing includes those bytes; resumed stages keep their frozen membership
and fail without truncation when they cannot fit.
Use `--authoring-revision exact_identity_namespaces_v1`, `exact_identity_namespaces_v2`,
or `exact_identity_namespaces_v3` for their respective prior namespaced
replay and `--authoring-revision legacy` for older normal prompt/schema replay;
low-level Python callers select `RECONCILIATION_AUTHORING_IDENTITY_V4` explicitly
for current generation. Explicit response-v2 and older-method public defaults,
missing-definition requests and local repairs keep their historical behavior.
For a verified method-v7 continuation, explicitly request response v3 on a fresh
stage to use that same decision compiler, source-role guidance and identity-v4
packing. Preserve the method-v7 input identity and historical attempts. This
removes exact source copying from the model's work without weakening claim-kind
competence or pretending that a new prompt was used for an old answer.
Preserve each accepted response's actual attempt and correction provenance;
never rebind it to a newly rendered unused request. The semantic-integration
contract v104 owns this normal-authoring boundary. Semantic preservation and
upstream identity truth remain judgment-owned; preventing incompatible attempts
also removes their incidental discrepancy signal, with no equal-discovery claim.
Current response-v3 authoring and review apply the intelligence claim-support
contract's **Meaning-preserving interpretation and useful abstraction** rule.
Interpret ordinary language in context and consolidate a useful common claim
when each supporting child establishes it; do not demand the same words or
identical detail. Keep source-specific detail, conditions and uncertainty with
their evidence. Shared interest is not completed behavior, and a shared axis is
not automatically corroboration. The same rule governs review; no growing list
of phrase-specific owner exemptions or additional provider pass is required.
The semantic-integration contract's compiler-owned-count boundary also governs
bounded wording: normal response-v3 and missing-definition prompts request
count-neutral reported propositions, not inferred author headcounts. Preserve
source-attributed statements about others as attributed. Oppositely oriented
comparisons remain separate under the existing exact-identity node shape even
when they express the same fact; separation does not create extra observations
or people. These instructions do not make semantic prose mechanically verified.

Use `prepare-reconciliation-level --existing-stage <stage.json>` to render new
requests for an unchanged partially completed stage. Oversized resumed current
prompts may compact JSON whitespace without losing content or repartitioning.
Accepted responses are not regenerated merely to change transport. Explicit
`--response-version semantic_evidence_reconciliation_response_v2` retains old
prompt replay; stored v2 responses can coexist with v3 responses at submission.
The downstream node-compilation shape and normal-path semantic provider-stage
count stay unchanged. Historical method-v11-and-earlier preparation remains unchanged.

If the current consumer raises `MissingReconciliationDefinitions`, use the shared
failure-only `prepare-reconciliation-definitions --bundle ... --stage ...
--failed-response ... --output-dir <fresh-request-directory>` command. It binds
the failed bytes and requires a definition or explicit cannot-define answer for
every missing key, using only the affected candidate groups. Run that request
through the existing isolated provider/usage route, at `high`, keeping each
attempt immutable. Allow at most one corrective attempt before returning a
remaining failure to judgment. Successful batches need no extra call.

Before choosing any current response-v3 repair scope, run the no-provider
`diagnose-reconciliation-response --bundle ... --stage ... --response ...
--diagnostic-out <fresh-json>` command once on the failed response. It preserves
the validator's exact first failure while listing the other independently
observable bookkeeping defects and the candidate/node handles they affect.
Checks made unknowable by malformed prerequisites are listed as skipped rather
than guessed. The result is a repair-planning aid only: `valid: false` remains
unaccepted, the command never edits the response or chooses a correction, and
structural findings do not prove that any wording or relation is semantically
wrong. Contract v103 owns this boundary.

Submit with `submit-reconciliation-definitions --bundle ... --stage ...
--failed-response ... --request <request.json> --patch <corrective-response.json>
--output-dir <fresh-successor-directory>`. It preserves existing decisions and
definitions, adds only model-authored missing nodes, and validates the complete
successor at the normal consumer. Use that successor explicitly at level
submission; never overwrite the failed response or treat its receipt as a success.
An unsupported grouping, incomplete patch or other newly exposed defect blocks
publication. Reuse a matching validated successor without a new provider call.
The generation schema also forbids an empty definition list when retention
requires findings; it cannot guarantee every referenced definition exists.
Exact bindings and completeness do not prove semantic warrant. The semantic-
integration contract's v88 recovery boundary owns these rules.

For current decision-only requests, the response schema couples terminal status
to its claim metadata: claim kind and causal ceiling are null for a nonterminal
node and populated for a terminal node, while a terminal opposition-check flag
must be a boolean. This prevents provider-visible structural combinations the
native consumer has always rejected; it does not judge whether the claim itself
is true or whether opposition was adequately reviewed. Historical v2 schemas
replay unchanged.

Current decision-only authoring also requires one relation per exact
candidate-and-node pair. A candidate may attach to multiple distinct bounded
meanings, but it must not attach to the same node once as support and again as
counterevidence. The unchanged native consumer rejects that ambiguous duplicate;
the prompt states the invariant before generation without weakening the
consumer check. Dieux level-3 dogfood still produced this invalid shape, so the
consumer remains the reliable enforcement and prompt-level prevention is not
proven.

For a named grouping, wording, status or attachment defect (including an issue
found by source-aware review despite structural acceptance), use
`prepare-reconciliation-repair --bundle ... --stage ... --failed-response ...
--nomination <json> --output-dir <fresh-request-directory>`. The nomination is
`{"node_keys": ["..."], "candidate_refs": [], "reason": "source-backed issue"}`;
either list may be empty but not both. The producer expands to the connected
component, supplying source-owned meaning, exact evidence/contexts and separate
source inventory. It does not detect prose errors or award claim support.
Before writing the request, preparation rejects and names every incompatible
product/comparator/version group left outside that scope. Explicitly include
those groups in the nomination before spending the corrective call; code never
silently broadens the scope or chooses their replacement meanings. Other native
or semantic defects can still remain, so this is not a complete error census.
Current optional retention schemas disallow simultaneous attachments and an
unmerged reason before submission, while native guards remain unchanged.

Preparation returns `worker_prompt`, `job_path` and `job_sha256`. Forward that
generated prompt unchanged to the fresh corrective worker. It uses the same
`intake-judgment-job` delivery as normal judgments: both output allowances,
separate bounded notifications, byte counts and contiguous offsets. The job
pins the request, evidence and authority files; changed bytes fail before intake
or submission. `submit-judgment-job` routes this repair to the existing repair
consumer, writing `successor/response.json` and its receipt within the request
directory. Do not handwrite a separate delivery wrapper. This changes transport
only, not repair scope, semantic instructions or the one-attempt rule.
The three-case test of this generated launcher, including each exact executed
wrapper, is recorded at `docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-repair-expanded-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).
The earlier hand-prescribed delivery test it supersedes is at
`docs/research/judgment-spine/harness/worker-efficiency-20260912/evidence.json` (record `forseti-repair-intake-fix-20260912-v1/RESULT.md`).

When that freshly written diagnostic is invalid and its complete issue set is
exclusively cross-child `duplicate_leaf`, pass the same file as
`--diagnostic <diagnostic.json>` to `prepare-reconciliation-repair`. This selects
the compact structural renderer: it supplies only the affected already-validated
child definitions and their bounded statements, conditions, identities and
provenance paths; current affected decisions and parent definitions; and the
deterministic forbidden same-node leaf paths. It omits raw evidence and context
bodies rather than truncating or claiming to reread them. The provider still
chooses the semantic restructuring, and the ordinary composer plus unchanged
whole-response validator remain final. A stale diagnostic, mixed issue class,
skipped dependent check, omitted diagnosed scope, clean response, or repeated
leaf confined to one child blocks this mode. A convergence-mode stage also blocks
it, because convergence retention counts repeated distinct source rows this
projection does not carry; use the general repair route for that level. Without
`--diagnostic`, the existing general repair and historical replay path is
unchanged.

If the native failure is a reused node key, explicitly nominate that key. The
repair request includes every definition sharing it and every connected
candidate/source, and the provider must return unique bounded replacements.
Never rename or redistribute duplicate meanings in code. A duplicate outside
the connected nomination blocks preparation by name.

Oversized local repairs try the lossless `PACKED_REPAIR_CONTEXT_V1` table layout
inside the same preparation command. Shared fields and column headings remove
repetition, not evidence: every source, candidate, context and attachment stays
in the connected scope. Previously fitting repair requests replay unchanged.
The same byte limit applies after packing; no truncation, larger limit, extra
provider call or automatic semantic repair is introduced. The consumer binds
the full original context and rederives the exact rendered request.

After one bounded corrective attempt through the existing provider/usage route,
submit with `submit-reconciliation-repair --bundle ... --stage ...
--failed-response ... --request <request.json> --patch <response.json>
--output-dir <fresh-successor-directory>`. Use the verified successor explicitly
in the continuing selection. Refusal, foreign scope, unsupported grouping,
missing context, over-limit context or another native failure remains blocking.
Never clear a problem by automatic relabeling or discarding counterevidence.
The semantic-integration contract v107's **Local reconciliation correction**
section owns this failure/review-only route and its semantic non-claims; it adds
no standing provider stage and does not replace source-aware judgment.

When that exact patch is scope-valid but full validation reveals a different
independent defect, compose it as an explicitly unaccepted intermediate before
preparing the next existing bounded repair: `compose-reconciliation-repair
--bundle ... --stage ... --failed-response ... --request <request.json> --patch
<response.json> --output-dir <fresh-composed-directory>`. Bind the source
response, request, patch and intermediate hashes. Never place the intermediate
in the selection or treat composition as validation. This preserves the first
edit without a whole-batch rerun; it does not authorize automatic repair, an
unbounded retry loop or another normal-path stage. When the newly visible error
is a missing definition, `prepare-reconciliation-definitions-after-repair` takes
the same bound inputs and writes that intermediate plus the existing definition
request and its chain receipt. Apply the same rule when a missing-definition
patch reveals the next independent native error: compose its exact unaccepted
intermediate with `compose-reconciliation-definitions`, then use the existing
bounded preparer for that error. Both composers report
`..._COMPOSED_NOT_ACCEPTED` with `accepted: false`, and the chained preparer
reports `intermediate_accepted: false`; all three make no model call and refuse
to write into an existing directory. The semantic-integration contract v100 owns
this layered-failure boundary.

If response validation failed after usage was saved, publication may be retried
without a new model call. The existing usage receipt must equal the bytes
rederived from the same response, event stream, and caller schema; changed
receipts or executor outputs fail. This never overwrites an existing canonical
response and never promotes a timed-out or unfinished execution.
Before invoking the caller's validator, publication rejects duplicate JSON
object keys at every depth using the same decoder hook as the public semantic
runner. Rejection preserves the raw answer and exact usage; parsed last-key-wins
objects are not valid evidence of exact decision coverage.

The filesystem behavior lives in `forseti-harness/provider_attempts.py` and
performs no model call. The Phase A commands above are compatibility adapters:
they add evidence-selection response validation while reusing the same unique-
attempt storage. Other intelligence-cycle stages may reuse the helper when they
have the same parallel/retry proof shape; it is not a mandatory wrapper around
all model activity.

For current unattended Codex jobs, replace task-local buffered launch wrappers
with `forseti-harness/runners/run_codex_provider_attempt.py`; its execution
contract and command live in `forseti-harness/README.md` under "Unattended Model
Attempts". It reserves the attempt itself, preserves logs live, and bounds the
entire attempt without resetting the clock on reconnects. Use the existing
stage validator/publisher afterward, not process exit as acceptance. Frozen
historical wrappers and receipts remain provenance; do not rerun or rewrite them.
The shared execution boundary adds no model stage or automatic retry.

The confirmation frontier is independent of the first-pass relation. Therefore
a first-pass `exclude` cannot silently hide a materially engaged or protected
row. The confirming response may correct the relation and reason code; selection
then runs once over the corrected inventory. Every finally displayed row must
have crossed that confirmation boundary. Missing, duplicate, foreign, reordered,
or unconfirmed rows fail closed. Historical v6 quote manifests retain their
selected-row confirmation route for exact reproduction; they are not silently
restamped as v7.

Historical non-value axis-expanded point packs use `recent_year_coverage_v1` as a display
preference. The latest two calendar years present in that eligible pool receive
representation across available venue/role/native-metric buckets, up to half
the thirteen-origin cap after mandatory relation/protection reservations. When
eligible and space remains, one dated pre-window origin is retained so the
recent view does not erase earlier history. Undated rows remain in complete
candidate accounting. Age never changes a relation, independence, materiality,
or evidentiary weight. The final artifact groups selected IDs by literal
calendar year, with unavailable dates separate, and uses no strong/weak or
fresh/stale age judgment. Within a fixed venue/role/native-metric bucket,
source-native engagement still orders candidate display; it is never compared
across platforms, and an unavailable metric never sorts as observed zero. The
timeline is only a calendar ordering index: consumers dereference each selected
ID through `source_groups` and preserve its truth-support or influence layer.

## Operating path

### Supported operating route

For authorized Evidence Consolidation, use the public composed entrypoint:

```powershell
python forseti-harness/runners/run_semantic_evidence_integration.py advance --source <materialized-source.json> --run-dir <run-root>
```

Keep the same source and packing options on resume (`--max-prompt-bytes` and
`--max-evidence-per-work-unit` when explicitly selected) and any commissioned
[experimental route option](#experimental-route-options). Dispatch the complete
compatible `judgment_requests` set through the existing active-agent lane, one
fresh context per independent request and at most three concurrently. Do not
reconstruct the mechanics in a new wrapper: forward the returned `worker_prompt`,
which binds both tool output allowances and emits all content as separate
bounded `notify` outputs within one tool invocation (no model turn between
pieces). Accumulated `text` items can share one truncation limit. Inspect
both tool layers' truncation metadata/warnings; an end marker alone can survive
middle truncation. Do not
carry previous jobs' conversations into a new extraction, verifier, or
reconciliation request. Each worker calls `intake-judgment-job --job <job_path>
--job-sha256 <job_sha256>` using the returned binding: this returns the complete
hash-verified prompt, schema and role guidance together. Read all content and
the final `intake_end` marker; a truncated tool return is incomplete intake,
not permission to judge clipped evidence. Allow sufficient tool output for the
complete payload. The worker writes one complete raw JSON answer and calls
`submit-judgment-job --job <job_path> --job-sha256 <job_sha256> --response
<raw-answer.json>`. Code checks identity, runs the existing phase validator,
publishes exact bytes without replacement, and retains a compact receipt.
Workers do not author mechanical validation scripts. Preserve independent
extraction/verifier judgments, then call `advance`
again on the published results. Do not split preparation, submission, validation,
normal reconciliation levels/convergence, and final compilation into trivial
controller turns. The operation carries those deterministic steps through their
native gates, reports exact prompt/schema/response and accepted-artifact bindings,
and stops at required meaning judgment, an actionable failure, or `view.json`.
There is no fixed model-call quota. Existing per-stage commands are recovery and
historical replay seams, not the normal execution sequence.

Desktop accumulated tool output can truncate despite larger allowances; use
the separate `notify` outputs in the generated prompt. Stop before judgment
when complete visibility cannot be obtained. The native log retaining all bytes
does not prove that the worker saw them; the semantic contract owns this boundary.

Accepted artifacts under `extraction/`, `verification/`, and
`reconciliation/level-NNNN/` are revalidated and reused on restart. Invalid or
staged artifacts block with their paths; missing responses remain judgment work.
Do not replace accepted answers or rerun completed semantic work to clear a
mechanical interruption. Source/identity changes require the existing explicit
successor/reopen authority. The final view remains bound to the current corpus;
the command grants no acquisition, global v34 closure, seal, or synthesis authority.

### Evidence flow and method context

```text
SERP map
  -> native customer-evidence acquisition
  -> complete Reddit/community and retailer-review source accounting
  -> run-local stable product identity
  -> Collection materialization
       -> hash-bound semantic source + matching lineage receipt
  -> Evidence Consolidation (verify materialized source hash)
       -> semantic leaf assessment
       -> atomic evidence structuring
       -> meaning-based cross-source reconciliation
       -> proposition/axis evidence packets
  -> acquisition seal when the current route contract is satisfied
  -> Synthesize / Deliver judgment
```

For each company, Phase A first verifies its products and the source-native IDs
used by each retailer or community coding artifact. The run then supplies a
small product-identity table. That table says, for example, that Sephora
`P455936`, Amazon `B0C42HJRBF`, and the verified relevant Revolve listing IDs
are presentations of Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm for this run. Every map
entry cites preserved source evidence. Unclear equivalence stays unresolved.
For a method-v4 full run, that verified table is included once in every
reading assignment. It lets a worker name the same stable product across
Reddit and retailer evidence even when a Reddit leaf arrived without an
upstream product candidate. It does not assign by keyword: the leaf and its
conversation or product-page context still establish the subject.

The semantic workers read every admitted customer leaf. They interpret meaning
rather than exact wording and keep support, disagreement, conditions,
comparisons, uncertainty, and product versions separate. Reconciliation may
then join a Reddit observation and a retailer review when they concern the same
stable product and bounded meaning. It does not merge them merely because they
share a phrase.

A full-corpus run uses the run-v3 / bundle-v5 / method-v5 generation. Every
assessable leaf still receives exactly one context-aware judgment, made after
reading its parent and container context; there is no keyword or phrase gate,
and a short referential reply that adopts a specific parent complaint,
preference, product, or variant stays claim-bearing. What changes is only what a
leaf costs after that judgment: a leaf that is clearly outside scope, or clearly
inside the context but carrying no bounded proposition, terminates immediately
with no semantic unit, axis assignment, reconciliation candidacy, or packet
delivery. Ambiguous binding stays `unresolved` rather than being pushed into a
cheaper terminal disposition.

For a context-dependent short reply, operators and adjudicators inspect the
root question, immediate parent, and leaf together. They record the resolved
reading and keep separate what context supplied from what the leaf asserted.
For example, `which is your favorite?` -> `Vanilla Beige!` -> `My fav!` means
the final author also prefers Vanilla Beige. The leaf is claim-bearing
`personal_agreement`, not first-hand product experience. Because the two
visible handles are distinct, the pair may support same-thread recurrence for
that exact preference, with thread co-location disclosed; it is not
cross-venue corroboration and supplies no product axis. This is valid but
low-information recurrence: the child adds no reason, attribute, condition, or
explanatory detail. A reply such as `same` adopts only the clearly targeted
bounded meaning, not every clause of a multi-point parent.

Workers report those terminal decisions either individually or as explicit-ID
groups sharing one agent-authored reason. Grouping is transport compression, not
a sample or a default: every evidence ID is listed, raw occurrences are checked
for duplicates and unexpected or omitted IDs before anything is normalized, and
the durable raw response stays the record of evidence through hash-bound
compilation lineage. The new projection carries no static worker partition, so
any available worker takes globally missing work and atomic no-overwrite
publication remains the only durable truth boundary. Bundle and projection
verification happens once per controller invocation rather than once per
response.

The legacy v4 generation is unchanged and remains byte-reproducible; the paused
v4 run's artifacts are not migrated or restamped.

The final Evidence Consolidation packet is a retrieval surface. Asking for an
axis or bounded proposition returns the complete linked evidence union,
including counterevidence and unresolved adjacent material. Deliver owns any
later recommendation about price, premiumization, positioning, product work,
or campaign action.

The normal `project-evidence-packet` command emits
`phase_a_evidence_packet_v3`. It keeps v2's one-copy, source-grouped evidence
catalogue, but declares repeated evidence, engagement, and semantic-unit field
names once as named columns. Values shared by every row in a packet or source
group appear once as named defaults at that scope; all remaining row values map
positionally to explicit human-readable column names. Proposition rows still
link literal evidence and semantic-unit references under support, counter, or
adjacent relations. Raw engagement, observation time, source context, actor and
independence, conditions, behavior, uncertainty, and full-body bundle
resolution remain available. Operators do not select examples, supply a top-k
cap, perform a new lookup, or request v3 through an extra flag. Explicit v2 is
the matched comparison route; v1 is historical reproduction.

Use `--all-propositions` when the downstream customer-pull frontier needs the
complete finalized view. The runner expands that selection from the view itself
rather than requiring one command-line argument per proposition; it cannot be
combined with axis or explicit proposition selection.

### Adopted token-cost baseline

On 2026-08-16, `phase_a_evidence_packet_v2` was adopted as the provisional
Phase A token-cost baseline. A matched model experiment compared v1 and v2 on three
frozen Summer Fridays propositions with 43, 20, and 9 evidence items. Each arm
used the same prompt and output schema for three repetitions, with arm order
alternated: 18 `gpt-5.6-sol` low-reasoning turns in total. V2 used 121,008
versus 183,786 input tokens, 85,179 versus 114,462, and 69,995 versus 88,508.
That is a reduction in every case (34.158%, 25.583%, and 20.917%) and 28.590%
across the matched set.

The saving is transport normalization, not evidence selection. V1 repeated
complete evidence content and proposition-local representations; v2 keeps one
evidence row and one selected semantic-unit representation, moves repeated
source semantics to a group header, and lets propositions reference those
units. The experiment returned 18 structurally valid responses with the
correct proposition IDs, no missing or invented cited references, and the
required condition, behavior, engagement, and uncertainty fields. Independent
semantic adjudication was not run, so the experiment establishes a structural
quality floor rather than semantic equivalence. Latency is explicitly
non-gating for this baseline; no storage-cost claim is needed.

This baseline must be reversed or revised if representative future cases lose
required evidence or resolvability, fail the structural citation floor, or no
longer save input tokens against v1. The legacy-v1 route is the comparison and
reproduction control, not a second normal operating mode.

#### Adopted v3 successor

`phase_a_evidence_packet_v3` supersedes v2 as the normal token-cost baseline.
The pre-bound adoption threshold was lower input tokens in every frozen case
and at least 10% aggregate reduction, because a smaller gain would not justify
a new schema generation and consumer surface. Across three alternating matched
repetitions of the same three Summer Fridays cases, using the same prompt,
output schema, `gpt-5.6-sol`, and low reasoning, v2 used 121,002, 85,173, and
72,341 input tokens; v3 used 99,225, 72,461, and 64,673. V3 reduced tokens in
every case by 17.997%, 14.925%, and 10.600%, and by 15.136% in aggregate
(278,516 to 236,359).

The saving is lossless transport normalization. The projector first builds v2,
then hoists only exactly repeated named values and serializes the remaining
values under explicit columns. A fail-closed preservation boundary rejects any
changed top-level payload, source-group evidence row, or proposition relation
before v3 can be returned or hashed. Focused tests deliberately removed one
relation and changed one engagement value; both failed at that boundary.
Identical input produced identical bytes and packet hashes.

All 18 model responses were structurally valid, used the correct proposition,
populated conditions, behavior, engagement, and uncertainty, and cited only
literal evidence or semantic-unit refs present in the supplied packet. The v2
and v3 packets preserved exact proposition IDs, admitted evidence IDs, and
semantic relation refs. Independent semantic adjudication was not run, so this
is a structural preservation and model-usability floor, not semantic
equivalence. Latency was non-gating; observed aggregate wall time was 3.013%
lower and cannot rescue or veto the token decision. Storage cost was not used.

The matched receipt is
`C:\tmp\forseti-phase-a-columnar-v3-success-test-20260816-v0\model_experiment_result_v1.json`
(raw SHA-256
`a1b0126f4eb950c30caf4bdb233723c0fcf1f0113b66679dcc03785916780697`).
Reverse to explicit v2 or revise v3 if a representative packet loses required
meaning or resolvability, produces an absent/invented cited ref, or fails to
save input tokens; a future independent semantic adjudication that finds
material output degradation also triggers reversal.

The column-interpretation residual was then tested on three withheld layouts:
an entirely unfamiliar seven-row fixture with unavailable engagement throughout,
a Birthday Cake proposition where one evidence item carried two relations, and
a three-source-group Pink Sugar conflict with heterogeneous engagement values.
Across three alternating repetitions per v2/v3 arm, both arms reconstructed all
30 requested rows and all 600 labeled fields exactly. V3 produced zero wrong-
column, wrong-row, formatting, missing/invented-reference, relation-integrity,
or synthesis-structure errors and used 180,671 input tokens versus v2's 187,885
(3.840% lower). This closes the observed model-readability concern and makes v3
the accepted token baseline for this lane. It remains same-vendor evidence, not
independent semantic adjudication. The receipt is
`C:\tmp\forseti-phase-a-columnar-v3-holdout-20260816-v0\holdout_experiment_result_v1.json`
(raw SHA-256
`d50aa9691d1ef51d5d92b977306e4648664339d3828b2d740bf5f176c26ba59b`).

#### Adopted decision-only related batching

Keep `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3` as the packet baseline. For downstream
consumption, run `prepare-evidence-consumer-batch` on the smallest group of
actually related cases: every multi-case batch must bind the same corpus and
bundle and share proposition-linked evidence. Do not combine unrelated cases
to manufacture savings. Non-related cases use singleton preparations. Send the
emitted prompt and response schema to the external fresh-agent call, then pass
the response and hash-bound manifest to `finalize-evidence-consumer-batch`.
The repository runner still makes zero model API calls.

The model response owns only the synthesis judgment and literal support and
counter refs. Finalization reattaches exact source facts from v3 and rejects
case/proposition cardinality or order changes, foreign refs, malformed or
missing engagement, failed lookups, and wrong row/column attachments. Packet
content, unresolved/unmerged material, adjacent relations, provenance,
identity, dates, conditions, uncertainty, causal ceiling, and bundle-backed
full-body resolution remain source-owned rather than model-repeated.

The pre-bound six-family experiment used three alternating repetitions per arm
with `gpt-5.6-sol` at low reasoning. The current v3 full-response baseline was
394,189 input plus 42,120 output = 436,309 logical tokens (28,160 cached input;
2,504 reasoning-output subset). Unbatched decision-only control was 382,056 +
16,464 = 398,520 (95,488 cached; 901 reasoning subset). The smallest finalist
batched only the overlapping broad-adverse and burning-conflict cases, leaving
four singleton cases: 332,493 + 14,735 = 347,228 (33,024 cached; 764 reasoning
subset). Calls fell from 18 to 15. The finalist saved 20.417% versus v3 and
12.871% versus unbatched decision-only, without subtracting cached tokens or
double-counting reasoning.

Finalist and unbatched control artifacts were 18/18 exact. The finalist had
zero missing/invented refs, attachment or semantic-relation failures,
cross-proposition contamination, or `public_identity_key` errors; deterministic
rehydration was idempotent. Shuffled order, duplicate proposition, missing
result, foreign in-batch ref, cross-batch ref, and another proposition's
judgment each failed at the intended deterministic boundary. Baseline remained
15/18 exact, so its copy errors were not credited as candidate savings.

Accepted residuals: provider prefix caching varied and is not a logical-token
claim; latency and storage were non-gating; the model check used one vendor and
structural artifact validation rather than independent semantic adjudication;
and only the measured smallest shared-context pair earns multi-case adoption.
Reverse to unbatched decision-only responses if a representative related batch
fails exact reconstruction, contamination/failure-boundary tests, the 1%
per-family regression tolerance, or the 10% matched aggregate logical-token
gate. Reverse the whole consumer successor to the v3 full-response baseline if
deterministic rehydration cannot preserve the complete consumer artifact.

The matched experiment result is
`C:\tmp\forseti-phase-a-related-batching-20260817-v0\experiment_result_v1.json`.

#### Optional evidence selection and exact quotes

When the complete proposition-linked view is too coarse for commercially
useful presentation, bind one narrow evidence point and use the existing
no-provider evidence-consumer's
`prepare-evidence-selection`, `finalize-evidence-selection-relations`, and
`finalize-evidence-selection-quotes` operations. This is a consumer view over
hash-bound `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3`; it is not packet v4, a semantic replay,
or a second evidence authority.

Admission uses explicit product plus axis membership, with literal nominated
semantic or unresolved refs for bounded non-axis cases. A nomination that
cannot resolve fails closed instead of disappearing. The external relation
response must account for every admitted candidate before deterministic
presentation selection. For non-value work, its provider-visible envelope is a
named columnar semantic view: bounded meaning, conditions, polarity,
product/version scope, source role/layer, uncertainty, existing relations, and
compact same-evidence meanings. Dates, engagement, URLs, evidence identity, and
provenance remain in the hash-bound candidate inventory and are reattached
deterministically; omitting them from the prompt must never omit them from the
artifact. Value-only relation work retains the full candidate view because the
bounded commercial pilot found that compacting those 12 rows could weaken
`repeated purchasing despite price` into a generic value label. Each candidate
carries the other normalized meanings
from that same evidence item as context only, so a price complaint cannot hide
same-source purchase or repurchase intent. For value work, bind `price feels
high` separately from `not worth it`, and nominate an evidence item that records
purchase, repurchase, switching, return, or abandonment under the existing
`costly_behavior` protection when that behavior changes the commercial reading.
Candidate admission remains direction-neutral: admit the relevant positive and
negative value evidence before assigning claim-relative support or counter.
For a selection whose only axis is `value_and_quantity`, the external relation
response uses the value-box reason-code vocabulary emitted in its response
schema. Support or counter requires the candidate's own meaning to state a
price, value, quantity-for-price, purchase commitment, repurchase, or
benefit-for-cost tradeoff. Same-evidence companions may qualify a direct value
premise — for example, repurchase despite price discomfort — but a gift card,
single-variant trial, formula, hydration, scent, or generic purchase statement
does not become value evidence merely because another meaning from the post is
negative. Such rows stay adjacent and remain in the disposition inventory. Do
not search for complaints first and then treat the surviving set as the answer.
A relation label describes how the row bears on the bounded claim; it is not a
permanent positive/negative label. Thus purchase or repurchase despite price
discomfort may be presented as a positive willingness-to-pay or value signal.
When the evidence shows purchase, repeated ownership, or repurchase without an
explicit price premise, use the corresponding plain behavior label rather than
inventing "despite price"; likewise, quantity efficiency without an explicit
price judgment is labeled "a little product goes a long way," not "worth the
price."

Keep atomic semantic meanings and their refs separately recorded. In the
presentation layer, meanings from the same evidence item may be grouped when
they have the same actor, action, direction, and conditions. For example,
separate shade meanings may display as “intends to repurchase Vanilla and
Vanilla Beige” while both semantic refs and named shades remain underneath one
origin and one exact quote. Never group across origins, hide a conflicting
clause, or broaden a shade-specific behavior into general repurchase.
The cap applies to displayed independent-origin groups. The default is thirteen
customer truth groups per bounded evidence point, and one selection may
explicitly raise that customer cap to at most twenty when protected evidence or
a material conflict cannot fit; creator influence remains capped separately at
three. Do not use one broad axis as the point merely to obtain one large pack.
Do not raise the cap merely to make an output look comprehensive. A full-axis
Summer Fridays hydration comparison found ten materially thinner, fifteen
materially better, and twenty no better than fifteen under mirrored review, so
that exact full-axis hydration selection uses fifteen. This is a measured
selection setting, not a universal default for every axis. Source
roles and retailer venues remain visible, with each publisher normalized to one
venue across host variants and short links; creator-authored popularity never
corroborates customer experience. Engagement may prioritize rows only inside
one venue/role/native-metric bucket, and a count the runtime cannot read whole
is ordered last rather than partially parsed. An unrecognized mapping-valued
engagement shape fails closed rather than becoming an unknown value or generic
score. Every nominated safety or costly-behavior origin is selected first; more
such customer origins than the selection's bound cap fails
`presentation_cap_insufficient`, as does a protected set that fits the cap only
until the support and counter lanes are reserved. For
non-value selections, the selector then reserves visible support and counter
only from materially positive or explicitly protected evidence. A value-only
selection instead fills materially positive support origins first, prioritizing
purchase and repurchase behavior before other direct value meanings, while
still round-robining source-native venue/role/metric buckets. Before that
round-robin fills the remaining places, it anchors one primary positive origin
by value-signal kind: purchase and repurchase behavior outrank explicit worth,
which outranks price-to-quantity meanings. Stable source bucket identity breaks
cross-venue ties; native engagement ranks only within the already fixed bucket.
It may add at most one ordinary counter from that anchor's same
venue/role/native-metric bucket, ranked by that native engagement value. If no
positive support exists, it still shows one materially positive complaint: the
strongest native-engagement complaint from the complaint bucket chosen by the
same semantic-first, stable-bucket rule. If the comparable bucket has no direct
counter, it displays none. An already visible operator-protected counter
suppresses the ordinary counter, and at the cap an ordinary counter may displace
the most recently added ordinary support origin but never the anchor.
Operator-protected safety or costly-behavior rows remain mandatory. This does
not compare raw engagement across platforms or create a commercial-pull score.
Unprotected zero, quiet, and
engagement-unavailable rows stay in the complete disposition inventory but are
not forced into the main presentation merely to fill a lane or venue. If no
materially positive or protected counter exists, the main presentation carries
no counter rather than manufacturing one from weak response. Each protected
group records its required display lanes, and the deterministic minimum member
rows needed to cover them are shown; one origin may therefore display multiple
rows. Every operator-protected row is visible or the run fails. The retained
disposition inventory remains the accounting record for all other displayed and
undisplayed candidates.

One displayed pack is one bounded evidence point, not one broad axis. It may
contain up to the selection's explicit customer-origin cap, and one origin may display several atomic
meanings. Call those origins corroboration only when their meanings support the
same bounded statement under compatible product, variant, timing, and
condition scope. Origins that merely discuss the same broad axis remain
separate evidence, not an inflated corroboration count. A source reporting
another person's experience remains adjacent unless the directly quoted
speaker's own account is the evidence unit. Internal independence metadata is
kept for deterministic origin accounting rather than used by the relation
model to discard otherwise valid evidence.

For large non-value selections, use `prepare-evidence-selection-batches` and
`finalize-evidence-selection-batches` instead of asking one response to repeat
every candidate ID. The preparation emits at most 300 candidates per batch and
uses required named row slots (`row_0000`, `row_0001`, and so on) plus a
required single-valued `batch_id`. The provider returns that `batch_id` and the
relation for each slot. Row slots restart at `row_0000` in every batch, so
`batch_id` is what stops one batch's response from answering another: keep it,
or a response saved under the wrong name finalizes with complete-looking
coverage and systematically wrong relations. Finalization binds each slot back
to the hash-owned candidate identity, rejects a missing, foreign, or wrong-batch
response and a missing or foreign slot, requires exact contiguous coverage of
the complete candidate inventory, then continues through the ordinary quote
manifest. Only the batch responses named in the batch manifest are read; any
other file left in the response directory is ignored. Use a new canonical
response directory for each run and copy or project only the selected immutable
attempt responses into it. Never clear and reuse an attempt directory, and do
not rely on the finalizer to notice a stale file.
Batching does not change admission, selection priority, relation meaning,
evidence facts, or the origin cap. It does change the row label: a batched row's
reason code and display label are derived from its relation alone, so a batched
pack shows "Matching customer experience" or "Differing customer experience"
where the literal-ID path names the source meaning. Do not read a batched row
label as evidence meaning, and prefer literal-ID mode when the pack's row labels
matter to the reader. Literal-ID response mode remains the default and the
required mode for value selections; named positional batching is an opt-in
transport for large non-value axes. Its quote preparation emits
`phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v6`, which retains the v5 binding of the actual batch-manifest hash
and every canonical batch-response hash. The embedded selection manifest keeps
the canonical full selection identity; it is not evidence that its single large
prompt was sent. The v5 relation-transport binding records the prompts' actual
route.

The relation finalizer emits two independent provider workloads from the same
selected rows: exact-quote extraction and selected-row relation confirmation.
Run them concurrently when the provider route permits. The confirmation prompt
does not contain the first-pass relation, reason code, display label,
engagement, or selection priority. Its rows carry opaque `confirmation_row_id`
handles in a content-derived order rather than `selected_id` in selection
order, because selection order itself encodes the first pass: the protected and
reserved support/counter origins lead and the adjacent creator-influence block
always trails. The response must return every confirmation row exactly
once and in order; any missing, duplicate, foreign, reordered, or disagreeing
row blocks the final artifact. Finalization re-derives the confirmation
manifest from the bound quote manifest, so route the response back against the
manifest the harness wrote rather than a hand-assembled one. Do not combine
confirmation with quote extraction:
the bounded combined pilot classified all selected rows correctly but clipped
one exact quote mid-phrase. New v6 artifacts record the confirmation-manifest
hash and `passed`; historical v1/v3/v4/v5 artifacts remain readable under their
original contracts. Replay one by running
`finalize-evidence-selection-quotes` with neither `--confirmation-manifest` nor
`--confirmation-response`; supplying either fails closed.

The confirmation response also decides whether the supplied scope is one
specific direction-bearing proposition about one product attribute or outcome
under one compatible condition set. A claim that merely names an experience
area, or bundles materially different outcomes, directions, or conditions,
returns `broad_axis_or_bundle` and fails at `bounded_point_not_confirmed`. This
is part of the existing confirmation call, not a third provider task. Record
the passing reason on the artifact; the words `point_id` and `bounded_point`
alone never establish boundedness.

For a fresh point selection, exact linked parent text travels only with the
point's explicitly admitted semantic refs. It is deduplicated into a compact
parent-context table.
Every point-scope confirmation batch receives that same compact table so a
batch cannot decide scope from a context-stripped point. The table may clarify
the point, but it does not attach parent meaning to every evidence row: a row
may use parent content for its relation only through its own exact context ID.
Use it to resolve `same`, `this happened to me`, or another omitted referent
only when the parent itself names the same subject, attribute or outcome,
direction, and material condition. If the parent is merely a wishlist,
shopping question, broad discussion, or otherwise does not supply the missing
meaning, keep the terse row unresolved for that point. A source-native joined
experience such as becoming dry and cracked may remain one point; do not use
that allowance to join unrelated outcomes from separate sources. Historical
selection manifests without `linked_parent_context_v1` replay with their
original no-parent-context view.

Every completed v6 point pack discloses the funnel rather than presenting the
chosen rows as the whole corpus: candidate semantic rows, distinct candidate
evidence items, candidate truth origins, display-eligible truth origins,
displayed rows, displayed truth origins, displayed origins by relation, and
displayed creator-influence origins. Render those counts with the bounded
point. They describe evidence
accounting, not customer prevalence, and the full candidate-disposition
inventory remains attached. Do not read the candidate-to-displayed drop as cap
pressure: candidate truth origins are the admitted pool. The v6 quote manifest
records the truth selection policy, and the finalizer uses that exact policy to
count distinct origins eligible before the cap. A quiet origin is eligible when
its literal semantic reference is one of the accepted frontier point's bound
support, counter, or adjacent relations under
`literal_point_relations_display_eligible_v1`; this preserves the evidence that
actually admitted the point without treating quiet engagement as resonance.
Every eligible frontier-defining candidate is a mandatory display row and its
origin is reserved before ordinary cap allocation. Fresh complete-frontier
specs raise the ordinary thirteen-origin cap only to the exact number of bound
truth origins the point requires and hash-bind that cap. A point
requiring more than forty instead derives its exact complete cap from the bound
source packet: scope, every admitted relation and origin count must match at
preparation and source loading. Arbitrary selections retain the ordinary
ceiling. Bound the provider requests as described above; no source origin is
dropped merely to fit a request or a historical display ceiling.
Other origins with no operator-protected lane and no material positive
source-native engagement remain ineligible, and value-first also excludes an
otherwise material adjacent origin.
The artifact's `presentation_basis` names that gate, and also records that the
bounded point passed the separate scope classification; a broad axis or bundled
claim never reaches a completed point-pack disclosure.

Every selected row whose literal semantic reference helped admit the frontier
point keeps its complete bound source body as the exact quote. Deterministic
code verifies the packet, evidence identity, source identity, and body hash,
then copies the original body without asking a model to shorten, transcribe, or
substitute it. An absent body remains explicitly `quote_unavailable` with cause
`source_body_unavailable`; no parent, child, sibling, or engagement meaning may
replace it. Linked parent context remains separately bound reading context and
is never copied or spliced into the row's exact quote. This proves complete
row/body transfer, not that the chosen source or relation is semantically
correct; that remains the responsibility of the two relation judgments.

That failure removes only the affected literal support relation, not
automatically every other relation attached to the point. Counter and adjacent
relations are not eligible for this repair. After checking the bound source, an
author may rerun the point with a hash-bound `frontier_relation_rejections` row
using `literal_source_does_not_state_bounded_relation` for a wrong packet link.
Never substitute a nearby quote that states another product, state, or stage.
When the source does state the relation, current v10 authoring keeps its full
body; quote length is not a rejection cause. Historical v9 token-span authoring
retains its context-complete span rule and 220-character workload threshold. Historical v7
specs may retain `no_context_complete_quote_within_display_limit` for exact
replay, but new authoring must not create that cause. A genuinely rejected
semantic reference stays admitted and candidate-accounted, must be labeled
`exclude`, and cannot be forced into display or exact-quote work. The consumer
rechecks frontier admission from the surviving literal customer support. If the
surviving support no longer supplies reported behavior, independent customer
recurrence, or material source-native engagement, the whole point must be
rejected instead. This is not an allowance to hide counterevidence, quiet
evidence, or an inconvenient result. Materialize a wrong link with repeated
`--reject-frontier-relation <semantic_unit_ref>` arguments. The runner binds the
cause and resulting list.

For a whole-axis pack, thirteen is the maximum number of displayed distinct
truth origins **per bounded point**, not the size of the evidence corpus and not
an instruction to take the thirteen largest engagement values. The queue order
above first preserves the point's relation lanes and independent recurrence;
source-native engagement only breaks later ties inside a comparable venue,
role, and metric. Keep the completed point artifact's full
`candidate_dispositions`, `candidate_inventory_sha256`, selection-manifest
binding, and packet/bundle source pointers. The artifact therefore accounts for
every admitted semantic candidate while copying source bodies only for the
selected quote workload; a later operator can resolve an undisplayed candidate
through the bound packet and bundle rather than rerunning extraction.

Complete an axis as a set of independently finalized bounded-point artifacts.
Do not pad the set when a frontier proposition fails the existing
`point_scope` decision: retire that proposition with its literal failure reason
and report the smaller valid point count. A completed historical point may be
reused only as an immutable artifact under the exact policy revision and hashes
that produced it. If a staged historical manifest still needs quote completion,
either finish it with that exact historical consumer revision and disclose the
mixed lineage in the axis manifest, or rerun the whole point under the current
policy. Never make a current finalizer accept an old manifest by rebinding or
editing its hashes. An axis manifest references each point artifact path and
SHA-256, policy revision, exact selection-manifest path and stored/file hashes,
and quote-manifest path and stored/file hashes; it does not duplicate the point
artifacts' full candidate inventories. A sibling-file convention is not a
cold-reader source pointer.

An axis whose entire frontier fails completion remains a completed
rejected-only axis rather than disappearing or forcing a rejected point through
a projection. Every rejected row in that shape carries a literal,
SHA-256-pinned resolution receipt; the receipt binds the frozen source and the
failure boundary needed to understand or reverse the rejection. Rejected-only
receipt loading also verifies the receipt schema, exact `point_id`, and a
nonempty `failure_boundary`; a byte-valid receipt for another point is invalid.
Rejected-only axes produce no Direct Outcome or Decision State projection
because no accepted point exists to route.

When an axis has nonempty axis-tagged evidence but no admitted frontier point,
do not treat it as empty, invent a bounded point, or assign generic
support/counter relations. Materialize
`phase_a_evidence_axis_pack_manifest_v3` with
`materialize-no-frontier-axis-manifest`, then build and validate
`phase_a_evidence_axis_pack_v2` through the normal axis-pack commands. The
manifest pins the packet, bundle, frontier, exact semantic-unit membership, and
full candidate inventory. The pack retains every candidate's normalized
meaning, evidence/source identity, date, engagement, posture, uncertainty,
polarity, origin, and hash lineage while keeping literal source bodies and
parent context cold-resolvable through the pinned bundle. Axis admission
resolves no parent prompt, so the pack carries no `parent_context` field at all
rather than stamping every row with an empty one: an unresolved parent is never
presented as an absent parent, and a terse reply is never certified
self-contained. Its reading contract distinguishes routing relevance from point
relation, source-native resonance from truth, statement polarity from product
sentiment, and semantic/evidence/origin counts from people or prevalence. `no
admitted frontier point` never means `no evidence` or `no meaningful pattern`.

For a cold no-frontier read, prepare the dedicated reader request rather than
sending the verbose pack plus its derived accounting as one repeated prompt.
The request validates the complete pack, sends every candidate exactly once in
a compact columnar table, and deduplicates exact parent contexts recovered from
the pinned bundle. Every compact row carries its exact `evidence_id` and
`scoped_independence_key`, so repeated meanings from one evidence item or origin
cannot masquerade as extra people. Request-native parent-context wording makes
an empty context list an unresolved absence in the bound bundle, not proof that
the source is self-contained. The model may return only one to five `candidate_id`
handles plus an interpretation. Finalization rejects missing, duplicate, or
foreign handles and restores each selected example's complete frozen candidate
row and resolved parent context. The compiled output keeps the full-pool count
beside the displayed-example count and fixes relations to
`not_applicable_no_admitted_frontier_point`; examples never become the pool.

This route is Phase A evidence packaging, not point formation, point rejection,
or Deliver. It fails at `no_frontier_axis_status` if the verified frontier
already admits a point for the axis; use the point-bearing v1 pack and explicit
point-level projection route in that case. If a later frontier revision admits
a point, rebuild under that normal route rather than carrying the no-frontier
pack forward. Existing v1 pack and consolidated-view behavior remains the
compatibility path.

For point-bearing batched selection, the relation batch manifest already
contains the exact hash-bound selection manifest. Quote finalization and the
axis-pack accepted-point descriptor may consume that embedded manifest
directly; do not copy it into a second hand-maintained file merely to satisfy a
path convention. Each consumer recomputes the identity it relies on rather than
trusting a stored field: the axis-pack accepted-point descriptor rechecks the
batch manifest's own canonical hash before reading the embedded manifest, and
quote finalization rechecks the embedded selection manifest's canonical hash
through `load_selection_sources` plus the quote manifest's pin to it. Neither
consumer accepts a manifest hash it has not recomputed.

The live repository route for a point-bearing Phase A axis is
`phase_a_evidence_axis_pack_manifest_v1` ->
`phase_a_evidence_axis_pack_v1`. Use
`forseti-harness/runners/run_phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py
build-axis-pack --manifest <explicit-manifest.json> --output <new-axis-pack.json>`.
The manifest is a self-hashed JSON object with `axis_id`, explicit
`accepted_points`, and explicit `rejected_points`. Either list may be empty,
but not both: an axis with accepted points completes as
`complete_valid_axis_pack`, and an accepted-empty axis completes as
`complete_rejected_axis_pack` only when every rejected row carries its
resolution receipt. Every accepted point names its `point_id`,
`bounded_point`, `policy_revision`,
point-artifact path/file SHA-256, selection-manifest path/file SHA-256/stored
manifest SHA-256, and quote-manifest path/file SHA-256/stored manifest SHA-256.
Do not infer any sibling file. The builder independently reopens those literal
paths, verifies point and axis identity, candidate closure, the normal
thirteen-truth-origin cap, selection and quote lineage, packet
v3 identity, content-bound bundle identity, and packet-to-bundle binding, then
derives rather than trusts the pack's point, relation, origin, evidence, and
candidate counts. Accepted and rejected point IDs are unique and disjoint.
`policy_revision` is a declared operator pin rather than verified lineage: it
is cross-checked only against a point artifact that carries its own
`policy_revision`, and the completed Phase A point artifacts do not carry one,
so no completed point currently exercises that check.

Truth-origin counts admit only `truth_support` rows. Other displayed layers,
such as creator influence, remain displayed origins and displayed rows but
never enter `truth_origin_count` or `unique_truth_origins_across_axis`.

Validate a saved generic pack with
`validate-axis-pack --pack <axis-pack.json> --expected-axis-pack-sha256 <trusted-stored-hash>`.
Then build `phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidated_view_v2` with the same runner's
existing `build --spec <consolidation-spec.json> --output <new-view.json>` route.
The `phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation_spec_v2` spec explicitly pins the
generic pack path and raw file SHA-256, supplies presentation-only navigation
groups, and supplies `projection_routes`; both structures must cover every
accepted point exactly once. Navigation may group points for reading but cannot
merge propositions or grant evidence or relation authority. The v1 spec and
view remain accepted only so frozen historical artifacts rebuild without byte
or hash drift. Validate the saved view with `validate --view
<view.json> --expected-view-sha256 <trusted-stored-hash>`. Both writers refuse
overwrite, make zero provider calls, and reproduce identical output from
identical inputs.

Projection routing is point-level, not an axis-name allowlist. A model may
recommend the route while authoring the spec, but the declared spec is the
durable choice; the builder does not silently infer or change it. Use
`direct_outcome` when the point reports an attribute or experienced result,
such as hydration, drying, wear, texture, finish, scent, flavor, shade fit,
reaction, application, or comparator performance. Use `decision_state` when
the point reports an actor's judgment or action state, such as value judgment,
ownership, purchase, purchase intent, completed use, return, repurchase,
switching, recommendation, or abandonment. These are routing examples rather
than axis assignments: one named axis may contain points of both kinds.

The v2 builder implements both `direct_outcome` and `decision_state` at the
explicit point-level routing seam. Every routed v2 point carries forward its
existing boundaries that the presentation is not a causal judgment, not a
commercial-pull score, and that creator influence is not customer
corroboration. Direct Outcome preserves the v1 origin-normalized,
surface-separated projection. Decision State instead compacts explicit
spec-authored actor, object, judgment/action-stage, direction, quantity,
semantic-reference, and qualification facts without inferring states from
quotes, engagement, point text, or axis names. Value is the first full frozen
Decision State test subject; this does not make its findings prevalent, causal,
or representative of other products or axes.

A Decision State point may still carry nearby direct-result evidence. Preserve
such a row as explicit context only, with an empty state row list and complete
semantic references, instead of inventing a preference, intent, or behavior.
For `shade_and_color_fit`, for example, “Poppy appears sheer orange-red” may sit
beside a wearing or ownership point while remaining a color result. Keep “asks
Summer Fridays to release a mauve shade” as an assortment request rather than
purchase intent, and keep “aims to finish Pink Guava” as use-completion intent
rather than observed completed use. The point route stays explicit; this
context form does not silently reroute or discard the evidence row.
Likewise, a stated wish to try is trial intent rather than purchase intent, and
a received or otherwise acquired balm is acquisition rather than an inferred
purchase.

For each Decision State display row, the durable binding also names the exact
semantic unit or units that explain that row's point-relative
support/counter/adjacent relation. This is separate from the exhaustive list of
states present in the source: one source may discuss several shades or stages,
and the consumer must not follow an unrelated primary sentence when the
point-relevant meaning is a companion. A routed v2 Direct Outcome point may use
the same explicit relation binding when a frozen row's primary meaning is only
context; existing Direct Outcome specs remain unchanged when no binding is
present. Preserve a specific shown wearing as a wear event rather than ongoing
use, just as use-completion intent remains distinct from completed use.

For price-and-value evidence, Phase A keeps the exact comparison the source
made. If someone says “expensive for a lip balm,” keep “for a lip balm” in the
packed state rather than leaving it only in the quote. Keep these meanings
separate:

- `expensive` or `pricey` means the person feels the price is high;
- `overpriced` or `not worth it` means the person explicitly rejects the value;
- `premium` is a positive quality or positioning description only when the
  source supports it, never another word for a high price.

Also preserve value-at-price judgments, price-conditioned purchase or
repurchase intent, and observed purchase, use, return, switching, or repurchase
behavior. When one source carries several of these states, keep them together
without blending them. Price, value, intent, and behavior do not by themselves
prove pricing power or support for a higher tier. Phase A packs the evidence;
any later decision about positioning, elevation, or a higher tier belongs
downstream.

For hype and trust evidence, `expectation_judgment` keeps whether the product
met, exceeded, or fell short of the expectation the actor names. It is distinct
from `preference_judgment`: preferring one formula over another does not itself
say either product met its hype, and calling a product overhyped does not by
itself name a preferred alternative. One actor's generic “this is amazing” may
create a favorable overall product judgment when the actor, object, and
direction are bounded, but it proves no particular attribute, result, or hype
fit. Keep that limitation visible instead of rejecting the judgment or
inventing the missing reason.
For a hype- or expectation-dependent point, support and counter relations also
require that premise in the row's normalized meaning or same-source companion
meanings. Generic favorable or unfavorable performance remains adjacent rather
than being converted into “met the hype” or “failed the hype” from direction
alone. When the point explicitly attributes the judgment to hype, virality,
popularity, promotion, publicity, or marketing, the evidence must also name
that exposure; a bare “fell short of my expectations” does not identify what
created the expectations. For an expectation-only point that names no exposure
cause, explicit expectation language is sufficient.

The decision-object scope rule is axis-wide, not a hype-only exception. An
attribute-, formula-, variant-, shade-, scent-, or occasion-specific appraisal
is adjacent to an overall-product judgment unless the same source explicitly
reaches that whole-product verdict; an overall appraisal is likewise adjacent
to a narrower point unless it names that narrower object. This keeps useful
nearby information without silently changing what the actor judged.

The v2 spec carries the decision states in named fields; a cold operator authors
them explicitly and the builder never infers them. `projection_routes` is a list of
`{projection_mode, point_ids}` objects using `direct_outcome` or
`decision_state`. `decision_state_bindings` is a list of `{point_id, rows}`
objects that must cover every routed `decision_state` point and, inside each
point, every displayed `selected_id` exactly once. A row carries exactly
`selected_id`, `state_assertions`, `context_only_semantic_unit_refs`, and
`relation_semantic_unit_refs`. A state assertion carries exactly `state_kind`,
`commercial_direction`, `decision_object`, `semantic_unit_refs`, `quantity`, and
`conditions`; the judgment/intent/observed/event stage is derived from
`state_kind` rather than authored, `quantity` is allowed only for
`multi_unit_purchase` and must be at least two, and an unsupported `state_kind`
or an out-of-contract `commercial_direction` fails loud. Inside one row the
asserted and context-only semantic references must be disjoint and together
cover the display row's own meaning plus every same-evidence companion meaning
exactly once; `relation_semantic_unit_refs` is nonempty and drawn from that same
set. An empty `state_assertions` list is the explicit context-only form above.
Linked parent prompt text is not authored in this spec. The projector derives
it only from the hash-pinned candidate disposition that exactly matches the
displayed evidence and semantic unit. Before projection it removes only the
selection result fields (`relation` and `reason_code`) and requires the complete
remaining disposition inventory to match the selection manifest's source-derived
candidate hash; a spec-supplied replacement or rewritten candidate context is
rejected. That recomputation seals candidate content and linked parent context;
it does not cover `relation` or `reason_code`. The spec-supplied
`artifact_sha256` pins those final fields, but a hash records their bytes rather
than why a post-quote change was authorized. Do not hand-edit a finalized point
artifact to correct either field. Rerun relation confirmation, quote-manifest
preparation, and point finalization so the normal lineage agrees. If a frozen
artifact must instead be preserved, record every changed row, its before/after
relation, semantic basis, and exact source hashes in a durable home-adjudication
record before accepting the projection. The hype/trust pilot's thirteen
retrospective dogfood corrections are bound in
`docs/review-outputs/adversarial-artifact-reviews/phase_a_hype_trust_relation_narrowing_home_adjudication_v0.md`;
that one frozen disposition is not a reusable exception for later cycles.

A historical v2 routed `direct_outcome` point may use the optional
`direct_outcome_relation_bindings` list of `{point_id, rows}`, with rows of
`{selected_id, relation_semantic_unit_refs}`, when a frozen row's primary meaning
is context. Current authoring never treats that binding as optional. The optional
`decision_state_rejected_point_navigation` list
of `{point_id, navigation_group_id}` places rejected frontier points into an
existing navigation group and, when present, must cover every rejected point.
`decision_state_bindings_sha256` is optional in the spec and is checked against
the builder's own recomputation. Every field named in this paragraph and the one
above it, apart from `projection_routes`, is rejected in a v1 spec and in a v2
spec that routes no `decision_state` point.

New authoring uses `phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v10`,
`phase_a_evidence_selection_artifact_v3`, and
`phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation_spec_v4`. The existing hidden-label
preselection confirmation returns, for every confirmed candidate, the relation
and the smallest nonempty subset of that candidate's primary and same-evidence
companion semantic-unit references that explains it. This is part of the
existing batched semantic confirmation call; it adds no selected-row review,
consensus call, whole-axis reread, or other provider stage.

The v10 quote manifest uses `complete_available_source_body_v1`: after the two
relation passes, deterministic finalization copies every available selected
row's complete hash-bound source body and accepts no provider quote response.
Changed bodies or lineage fail locally; absent bodies remain typed unavailable.
Historical v9 manifests retain `row_owned_token_span_v1` and replay through
their original quote-response route. Complete body transfer prevents mechanical
clipping, transcription, and cross-row quote transfer. It does not prove that
the selected source or judgment-authored relation is semantically correct.

The v3 selection artifact carries those exact row-owned references. Every
displayed Direct Outcome and Decision State row in a v4 consolidation spec must
bind the same nonempty references. The builder rederives point, selected-row,
candidate, evidence, and semantic-unit ownership and rejects a missing,
duplicate, foreign, cross-point, cross-evidence, omitted, or changed binding at
the relation-binding boundary. It never chooses semantic references, infers a
relation, repairs a relation, or interprets prose. A structurally valid binding
therefore proves attachment integrity only; whether that chosen subset really
warrants support, counter, or adjacent remains a bounded judgment question and
is **not mechanically proven**. Rejected-only and no-frontier routes create no
point or relation. Historical v1/v2 consolidation specs and v7/v8 quote
manifests remain replayable; they are not upgraded or restamped. That replay
covers their own historical artifacts only: a v3 selection artifact routed by a
v1 or v2 spec is rejected at the relation-binding lineage boundary rather than
allowed to drop its row-owned references back to the primary reference.

At the current point-reader consumer, the relation-facing meaning is resolved
from those exact row-owned references. The selected row's primary meaning and
quote remain explicit lineage, not a substitute for a companion-only relation
binding. When the relation binds only a same-evidence companion and no quote span
owned by that exact meaning was captured, the relation-facing quote is
`quote_unavailable`; the selected-row quote remains separately visible. This is
mechanical attachment honesty, not a deterministic judgment that the selected
semantic subset warrants its relation.

When current packs regroup already judged Decision State evidence, use the
run-scoped Decision State reconciliation commands instead of copying a prior
row by `point_id`, `selected_id`, order, or any other presentation address.
Preparation pins every current pack/template and prior spec, then keys reuse to
the unchanged source-owned semantic identity: evidence ID, semantic-unit ref,
literal normalized statement, axes, conditions, and polarity. One complete
historical state bundle is reusable only when every matching prior observation
agrees. New or changed meanings, conflicting history, and incomplete multi-ref
state groups remain unresolved and are the only units included in the bounded
adjudication prompt. Finalization requires exact unresolved-unit coverage,
rebuilds current v4 row bindings, and runs the normal consolidation validator.
Relation refs remain point-relative and come only from the current v3 selection
artifact; they are never borrowed from history. This is a per-run delta
compiler, not a global semantic registry, ontology, or additional provider
stage. Deterministic agreement proves that the same authored judgment was
transported to the same unchanged meaning; it does not prove that judgment
semantically correct.

The retired selected-row v3 review was a rejected experiment, not a standing
diagnostic. The measured canonical-policy candidate was unstable: two shade
runs produced 14 and 59 invalid-row flags, while four formula runs produced 6,
4, 5, and 4; four earlier attempts failed before reaching the provider because
of orchestration configuration. Those counts do not measure repeated stability
of the shipped v3 prompt, which had only one historical run per axis and also
condensed canonical policy into a third policy. The 24 shade and 3 formula flags
remain unadjudicated allegations. Retirement removes one unbatched selected-row
whole-axis provider call; the pre-existing batched semantic confirmation remains.
No reader-quality improvement or semantic correctness follows from this change.

The built v2 view stores `decision_state_bindings_sha256` in place of the
authored bindings and adds `decision_state_index`, `decision_state_groups`,
`rejected_point_index`, and a `decision_state_reader_surface` join surface
whenever at least one point is routed `decision_state`. The full view's
`decision_state_contract` uses full-view table names; the reader surface derives
the same semantic contract with reader-native join instructions and
`semantic_unit_row_ids`, so every table and column named inside the compact
surface resolves inside that surface. Reader-surface v3 gives every
point-local `relation_facts` row an `evidence_row_id`: the zero-based row in the
global `evidence_table`, plus a `quote_row_id` for the zero-based row in
`quote_table`, and `relation_semantic_unit_row_ids` for the zero-based rows in
`semantic_unit_table`. The same fact carries `layer`,
`primary_semantic_unit_row_id`, `companion_semantic_unit_row_ids`, and direct
`context_only_semantic_unit_row_ids`. Relation, context-only, and state meanings
must belong to that exact primary-plus-companion ownership set, while
`state_binding_sha256` rechecks both state-row partitions. The compact surface
therefore preserves primary-versus-companion ownership without repeating point,
selected-row, quote, and full placement data in a separate placement table.
When a terse child reply needs its exact parent prompt,
the same fact carries paired `parent_context_ids` and
`parent_context_row_ids` into the deduplicated `parent_context_table`; empty
arrays mean no parent context is supplied and do not prove that the quote is
self-contained. The reader contract marks supplied parent rows
as context rather than evidence, makes venue and surface recoverable from the
literal `source_ref`, and states that source role and publication date are
unavailable rather than inventing either. The consumer uses those direct
handles, rechecks the evidence, quote, semantic ownership, state partitions,
and parent-context identities, and
resolves each semantic statement from its single global row before reading or
rendering meaning, source, date, venue, role, engagement, exact quote, or exact
parent context. This prevents an exact-looking finding from joining the right
quote to a neighboring evidence row's engagement value, lets deterministic
code render literal fields instead of asking a model to retype them, and
avoids repeating semantic statements or shared parent prompts inside every
point.
Every v2 point also carries
`same_origin_observation_groups`: one group for each displayed layer, relation,
meaning, and origin where that single origin carries more than one distinct
evidence-and-semantic-unit observation, each observation keeping its literal
evidence reference, date or explicit date unavailability, and source-native
engagement, and each group reporting a `source_observation_count`. That count is
a source-observation count, never independent-origin credit and never evidence
of several underlying purchases, uses, or completions; the owning semantics stay in
`forseti/product/spines/judgment/claim_support/forseti_intelligence_claim_support_contract_v0.md`.

Bind every emitted response schema through the provider's structured-output
mechanism (for local Codex CLI execution, `--output-schema`); including schema
wording in the prompt alone is insufficient. The finalizer must reject field
name drift, missing rows, and quote-boundary failures. A source-exact quote
shortened by an operator after such a failure is a disclosed corrected response,
not an unmodified provider result; prefer a bounded provider correction turn
and preserve every discarded-call cost either way.

The completed hydration-axis dogfood is the immutable completed example and
legacy compatibility input for this generic route. Its pack at
`C:\tmp\forseti-phase-a-hydration-axis-pack-20260822-v0\hydration_axis_pack_v2.json`
(raw SHA-256
`42f7fa0ca3c7d2000c77e97d37a429aa32c04c320aa2fa000a68b114acf9c77d`)
exercised this resume boundary. Nine completed points retained their historical
policy revision; two unresolved points were rerun under the current linked-parent
policy. The precise same-drying-and-cracking point passed, while “does nothing
for their lips” failed generically because it named no single material outcome;
the axis therefore contains ten valid points rather than eleven. Each valid
point accounts all 836 hydration candidates and displays thirteen
evidence-origin groups.
Across the axis that is 130 point-origin placements and 146 display rows, but
only 32 distinct origins and 37 distinct evidence items because one origin can
inform several precise points. The selected origins span Reddit, Amazon, and
Sephora; the artifact retains every undisplayed candidate disposition and its
source-resolution bindings. Exact-quote and attachment finalization passed for
all ten artifacts. The completion run used 1,095,340 logical tokens; 405,771 of
those belonged to ten discarded malformed calls caused by the initially
unbound structured-output schema and are not hidden as production success. Two
long-body quote responses were source-exactly shortened to complete sentence
boundaries after provider boundary failures and are disclosed as corrected
responses, not unmodified provider output. A cold-reader replay then loaded only
the v2 axis pointers, reverified each selection-manifest identity and candidate
inventory hash, resolved all ten bound packet/bundle sources, and matched all
8,360 point-candidate dispositions to their source-derived candidate IDs. Its
first local v1 index had named only artifact paths; requiring an inferred sibling
selection manifest was rejected as incomplete rather than reported as cold
resolvability.

Blind full-versus-compact dogfood builds its exact-fact answer key from the
validated consolidated view, never from a prose completion receipt:

The input must be a routed v2 consolidated view carrying point, placement, and
`projection_routes` facts. A frozen v1 view may still validate and rebuild for
compatibility proof, but it is not a dogfood-truth-index input.

```text
run_phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py build-dogfood-truth
  --view <validated-view.json>
  --output <new-truth-index.json>

run_phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py validate-dogfood-truth
  --truth <truth-index.json>
  --expected-truth-index-sha256 <independently-recorded-hash>
```

The generated index fixes accepted/rejected accounting, literal dispositions,
accepted-only projection routes, point meanings, preserved same-origin source
observations, and authored Decision State rows. It points disputed source,
date, engagement, origin, relation, quote, and companion details back to the
validated view. Absence from the small index is therefore not evidence that a
reader invented a detail. A completion receipt may explain execution, but it
is not evidence truth and must not replace this generated index or its source
view in a judge prompt.

Cold readers may search and stop when they judge that further reading has low
likely value. Dogfood grades the resulting Phase A brief, not whether the
reader opened every point artifact or repeated a coverage checklist. An omitted
low-value detail is not a failure; an actually false or misleading statement,
or a material omission that changes the practical evidence picture, remains a
failure. Token comparisons use the readers' natural consumption and compare
valid arms in aggregate. Preserve broken runs, but do not let an invalid and
artificially cheap arm establish compactness against a correct arm.

When a cold model must read a complete routed v2 axis, give it the generated
axis reader bundle rather than making it repeatedly join the consolidated
view's normalized tables. The bundle is a physical reading arrangement, not a
new evidence authority: its manifest points to the independently hash-pinned
validated view, while each manifest point names one point-local JSONL file with
one complete displayed fact per line. Each fact carries its point and route, point-relative meaning, literal
source/date/engagement, origin, relation, quote, companions, parent context,
and any explicitly authored Decision State together. Direct Outcome,
Decision State, and mixed axes therefore share one navigation method without
sharing or flattening their semantic payloads.

For scalable point-at-a-time compilation, use the point-reader run after the
routed v2 view is complete. This is the default route when points may be
processed independently, resumed, or selectively rebuilt. The older
`build-reader` bundle remains a validated reading arrangement and compatibility
surface; it is not the incremental run ledger.

The run freezes one identity per accepted point from the exact company,
product, cutoff, bounded point, route, point facts, point-scoped Decision State
ledger, source lineage, method text, response schema, reader policy, and point
brief schema version. Storage
paths, file times, and labels alone are not identities. A real change to any
meaning-bearing input creates a new point identity; an unchanged point reuses
its exact input, request, response address, and compiled brief across runs and
storage locations. The compiled brief is point-local. The complete axis output,
not each reusable brief, binds the current whole-axis snapshot and rejected
frontier.

Prepare all requests together so the snapshot is validated once. Each request
contains one complete point and asks the model only for the exact point-input
fingerprint, an interpretation, and point-local `placement_id` handles. The
fingerprint is required in the response, so moving an answer authored for an
older method, schema, point, or axis into a new filename fails before
compilation. A placement is the unique fact address;
the compiler, not the model, restores its literal quote, evidence and origin
identity, source venue/role/surface, date, native engagement, and relation. For
Decision State it also attaches the complete exact ledger, including every
state kind, stage, direction, object, quantity, condition, context-only row,
and awkward companion state. A coherently rehashed omission or cross-point
transfer therefore fails at the consumer boundary. Loading a saved brief or
axis output also reuses the compiler's nonempty, unique representative-handle
selection and displayed support/counter coverage checks, then requires the
saved brief to equal the brief that recompilation produces, so compiler-owned
fields are derived again; recomputed hashes do not waive those rules. The
interpretation and valid representative choices, including their order, are
reused from the saved brief rather than compared with the original response.

Finalization harvests every valid response or reusable brief even when another
point is missing. It then fails visibly and emits no axis output until every
accepted point appears exactly once with no foreign point. A retry needs no
response file for an already valid brief. Rejected points spend no model call:
the run generates one receipt for each rejected frontier row, bound to the
validated axis pack, and exact accepted plus rejected membership is checked at
assembly. This bookkeeping is local generated state, not a Data Lake object,
global index, new evidence authority, axis hierarchy, prevalence claim, or
Deliver recommendation.

The recurring cost is one complete source validation when a new snapshot is
created, one point request per changed point, and one linear local validation
and assembly pass. Request preparation, finalization, and public axis-output
validation each validate the snapshot once rather than once per point. They
reuse the already validated point payloads for every brief check. Do not place a
whole axis into every point schema or re-read every stored point while compiling
or validating each brief; those turn linear work into repeated whole-axis work
without adding truth.

The validator deterministically rebuilds the manifest and every point file from the bound view and
rejects a coherently rehashed omission, cross-point move, wrong relation, date,
engagement, source surface, quote, companion meaning, parent context, or state
transition at reader-bundle reprojection. Reader order is navigation rather
than rank. `bounded_point` remains the exact point meaning; a displayed fact
explains its relation but never redefines or broadens that point. A fact's
relation is authoritative for exactly the semantic
references listed in its
`point_relative_meaning.relation_semantic_unit_refs`: do not relabel it from
the wider quote or give it to any other same-evidence companion meaning. Keep
publication times literal and do not calculate elapsed time between
observations unless a source states the interval. Do not describe a whole
support, counter, or adjacent bucket from representative examples: either
verify every displayed fact in that bucket or use explicitly non-exhaustive
wording such as `includes`.
Likewise, exact relation counts and an all-evidence source-surface summary must
be derived from every fact in the point file. A summary labelled
`representative` may name only the facts actually displayed as representatives.
When a displayed representative is `quote_available`, either reproduce its
exact quote or retain `quote_span_id` with the point, evidence, and relation so
the bound quote is directly recoverable. Never substitute an unbound excerpt.
When a neighboring meaning is authored as support, describe it as evidence for
the exact `bounded_point`; never rewrite the admitted point as an OR-list of
neighboring meanings. Any output field for the exact or admitted meaning must
copy `bounded_point` verbatim and contain nothing else; evidence explanations
and qualifiers belong in separate fields.
Before reading selected examples as the axis, read the deterministic
`candidate_pool_accounting` carried by the reader. Its `display_panel` counts
only selected examples. Its `full_candidate_pool` counts every disposition for
that exact bounded point, including support, counter, adjacent, and exclude
rows; distinct evidence items; distinct origin groups; support-only,
counter-only, and both-direction origins; source-role splits; and origins with
material source-native engagement. Coexistence of support and counter means
the captured set is mixed, not that the two directions are equal. If the full
captured set has support or counter rows, state their exact counts and
source-role split before characterizing direction or balance; never let the
compact display panel stand in for the full pool. These are captured-corpus counts, not customer shares, market
sentiment, or prevalence. Material engagement describes resonance only and
does not increase truth or convert creator influence into customer
corroboration. Keep the default label lean: total semantic-row, evidence-item,
and origin counts; relation counts; direct-relation source-role and origin
overlap; independence posture; material-engagement origins; and displayed-row
counts. Venue, layer, polarity, uncertainty, dates, conditions, and raw
engagement remain recoverable from the hash-bound candidate ledger and are
drill-down evidence, not repeated default accounting.

For an evidence-rich axis with no admitted frontier point, build the same
reader-accounting projection directly from its no-frontier v2 pack. It reports
semantic-row, evidence-item, origin, source-role, independence-posture, and
material-engagement counts, while setting relations to
`not_applicable_no_admitted_frontier_point`. It must not invent a bounded point
or support/counter labels.

Each structured point brief also copies `displayed_relation_row_counts`,
`truth_origin_count`, and the exact point-local `candidate_pool_accounting` into
`reader_accounting`. These are exact displayed-row, full-candidate, and
origin-group accounting, never people, votes, corroboration, or prevalence.
Every compiled representative resolves `point_relative_meaning` and
`relation_bound_meanings` from the exact relation-bound semantic references.
The selected placement's primary meaning and quote remain separate lineage;
missing companion-owned fields stay null and are named in
`unbound_meaning_fields`, never borrowed from the primary meaning. The headline
meaning owns the headline quote even when a companion reference is listed first.
A repeated literal quote may therefore
appear more than once when it carries distinct bounded semantic units; the
quote or relation label alone is not allowed to erase that distinction.
Before a model emits that shape, bind the base output schema with
`bind-reader-output-schema`. Constrained decoding then keeps each emitted row's
point ID, exact meaning, route, and accounting object together; it does not
prove that every point appears exactly once. `validate-reader-output` is the
post-generation coverage and evidence backstop: it rejects missing or repeated
points as well as deterministic bookkeeping changes.
When a cold reader emits the structured Phase A brief shape, run
`validate-reader-output` before using it. This conditional local check rejects
missing or duplicated accepted points, point ID/meaning/route swaps, broadened
exact meanings, omitted or changed reader accounting, and representative quotes
moved across a point or relation, or an unavailable/unbound quote handle. It uses
the same relation-owned quote projection as the point-reader compiler: a
companion-only binding accepts honest quote unavailability and rejects its
neighboring selected-row quote. It costs no model call and is not required
when no structured reader brief is produced.

This exact validation is the standing cost for every generated reader bundle.
Blind full-versus-reader dogfood is not repeated for every ordinary future
axis. Repeat it only when the physical reader representation changes, a new
projection payload is introduced, or an observed axis exposes a material
reader failure. Such a representation-change comparison uses at least two
independent compact reads against one unchanged full baseline, mirrored opaque
labels, zero compact critical errors after home adjudication against the
authoritative view, no recurring material regression, and materially lower
logical tokens in each valid repetition. Bound each model call to one silent
30-minute wall-clock timeout; the local timer does not poll the model or spend
prompt tokens, and a timeout remains a visible invalid attempt rather than a
cheap compact result.
If a judge chooses the same opaque position after the candidates swap labels,
mark that pair `position_unstable` and exclude both preference votes; retain and
adjudicate its error findings. Only stable pairs contribute candidate or
baseline wins, so position bias cannot manufacture either result.

A model judge's critical-error report is an allegation until home adjudication
checks the cited placement against the authoritative view and its literal
source. Blind A/B preference measures reader utility, not factual validity:
position stability does not prove an alleged error, and position instability
does not create one. Only a source-adjudicated current critical error fails the
current representation's factual-quality gate.

Judge each quote against the specific placement and `quote_span_id` the answer
cites. One evidence item may lawfully carry more than one exact quote span for
different displayed facts; a judge must not reject one bound span merely
because another span from the same evidence ends earlier.

Downstream consumers use generic completed axis packs through the live derived
`phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidated_view_v2`, built by
`forseti-harness/runners/run_phase_a_evidence_axis_consolidation.py`. This is a
presentation view, not a packet v4 and not another evidence authority. It
accepts `phase_a_evidence_axis_pack_v1` as the live input and retains
`phase_a_hydration_axis_pack_v2` only for immutable hydration compatibility. It
reverifies the exact axis, point, selection, quote, packet, and bundle bindings;
keeps all ten bounded points and every claim-relative placement; stores each of
the 32 origins, 37 evidence items, 56 quote records, and 181 companion meanings
once; and leaves all 8,360 candidate dispositions cold-resolvable through their
owning point artifacts. Three navigation groups make the axis readable without
merging its propositions: hydration efficacy, drying consequences, and
comparator performance. Balm Dotcom and Rhode remain separate bounded points,
and delayed drying/cracking remains separate from direct drying.

For every routed v2 view, `bounded_point` on each point row is the authoritative
admitted meaning, including any literal comparator, time, or personal-fit term.
The full point entry carries deterministic displayed support, counter, and
adjacent row counts as `displayed_relation_row_counts`; the compact Decision
State point table carries the same displayed-row totals as `relation_counts`.
These are counts of displayed evidence rows, not distinct evidence origins,
people, prevalence, or the `source_observation_count` inside a same-origin
group. They may therefore exceed the same relation's distinct-origin count.
Placement normalized meanings explain point-relative relations; they may not
broaden, merge, or rewrite the point.
The compact Decision State reader carries the same six accounting rules in
shorter reader-native wording; this is wording compaction, not a weaker rule.

This named authority makes a broader point or a misreported count contradict
the emitted point row; it cannot force a non-compliant reader to obey. For
example, evidence about smoothness cannot truthfully widen a point that admits
only softness, and two displayed supporting rows from one origin remain two
rows but only one independent origin.

The view also separates Reddit posts from Reddit comments before presenting
source-native engagement. It does not normalize, percentile-rank, or compare a
post score with a comment score, retailer helpful count, another venue, or
another calendar-year bucket; undated engagement is explicitly non-comparable.
Repeated rows sharing one origin key remain one evidence-origin group, while
distinct actors in one thread remain distinct origins with that thread
concentration disclosed. The current axis has 32 evidence-origin groups: 30
carry `credited` independence posture and 2 carry `unavailable`; neither count
is a people or prevalence estimate. Each point carries its exact deterministic
support, counter, and adjacent origin lists directly as a consumer aid; those
lists are rederived from the preserved placements and cannot override them.
The point-level direct lists were added after the first compact dogfood made two
join errors while copying origin directions. That failed shape is negative
evidence and must not be restored merely to save more tokens.

Cold validation must receive the independently pinned stored view SHA through
`--expected-view-sha256`; copying the hash from the file under validation is not
a trust check. A wrong external pin rejects before reprojection. The zero-model

The completed ten-pack arm used 477,216 logical tokens; the consolidated arm
used 418,082, saving 59,134 logical tokens (12.391%) with lower provider input
in every repetition. The consolidated arm reproduced every point-relation
origin set in 3 of 3 repetitions; the ten-pack arm did so in 2 of 3. An opaque
same-vendor judge preferred the consolidated synthesis in all three primary and
all three mirrored comparisons, with zero material-quality failures and stable
ordering. Measured serial elapsed time was 547.708 seconds for the ten-pack and
494.333 seconds for the consolidated view, a descriptive 53.375-second
(9.745%) reduction rather than a latency guarantee or p95 claim. Cached input
is reported but never subtracted, and reasoning output is a subset of output,
never added twice. Those provider measurements belong to v5. The review-closed
successor
preserves every navigation group, point placement, relation, evidence fact,
quote, and companion meaning while adding the explicit 30/2 independence split
and denying comparison for undated engagement. No provider rerun was used to
pretend those metadata corrections were newly measured quality or latency. Its
same fixed prompt projects to 362,501 UTF-8 bytes versus the ten-pack's 501,073,
a static 27.655% reduction; logical-token and latency deltas remain the v5
measurements above.

That trust-bound file remains a frozen v1 artifact and is not rewritten by the
live v2 route. Its results establish the Direct Outcome predecessor evidence;
they do not themselves validate Decision State. The separate frozen value-axis
pilot exercises Decision State, and the separate frozen shade-axis pilot
exercises the mixed route -- one Direct Outcome point beside twelve Decision
State points -- together with the explicit point-relative relation binding. Their
frozen inputs are the two build specs
`C:\tmp\forseti-phase-a-delegated-adjudication-20260823-v0\value_spec_current_v2.json`
(raw SHA-256
`137c2697cf11c0e8fbf8160a417535acb63782c8d0b8fec4cc6c7b3a7d20cfc7`) and

`99b30fa86d7be7227a1fc85b7f19155a5e9ba6d51dc0ea75283f3fdf6a8988cf`). Rebuild each
spec with the runner's `build` route rather than trusting a stored view file: the
view files recorded beside those specs predate this change and no longer
reproject. Both routes preserve this Direct Outcome and v1 compatibility
boundary. Exercising a route is a coverage fact about that run, not evidence
that either axis is complete.

The completed production evidence still proves one hydration axis only. The
generic builder's deterministic two-point fixtures prove schema and parity
behavior, not another product or axis. This route does not change the
thirteen-origin selector, point relations, packet v3, or turn displayed origins
into prevalence. Reverse to the
ten-point source artifacts if deterministic reprojection loses any point,
relation, condition, comparator, quote, source binding, or cold candidate
access; if a representative cold consumer inflates origins or changes a
direction; or if matched logical-token savings fall below ten percent without
a position-stable material quality gain.

It reused the accepted historical fifteen-origin broad hydration selection only
to exercise the new confirmation and finalization boundary. A different model
family from the same vendor confirmed all 17 displayed rows, including the
known 922-point Reddit row as support, with zero disagreements. The call used
20,335 input plus 566 output logical tokens and completed in approximately 17
seconds. This is not cross-vendor adjudication and does not prove the new
thirteen-origin point default; deterministic runtime tests own that default.

Its accepted route accounted for all 836 candidates and selected fifteen
customer origins into seventeen exact-quote rows across Reddit, Amazon, and
Sephora. Ten of those origins carry a support row and six carry a counter row;
two origins carry both, which is why the per-relation counts exceed fifteen.
Required named slots fixed the observed long-array truncation, but increased
relation-stage logical tokens by 35.092% versus the exact literal-ID arm. The
batched arm's measured serial provider wall time was higher than the literal-ID
arm's, and the production route itself ran serially; the 51.736% latency
reduction is the modelled parallel critical path, available only if the batches
are actually issued concurrently. This is a completeness trade with a
conditional parallel-latency upside, never a token saving.

Read that receipt's own residuals with its numbers, because they qualify the cap
decision and are recorded nowhere else: the provider and the mirrored judge were
the same vendor; the mirrored named-versus-prior pack comparison was
position-unstable and therefore inconclusive; the packet supplies no TikTok
audience evidence for this selection; the provider calls used high reasoning, so
lower-effort behavior is unmeasured; and the receipt records
`repository_head_at_run` as the parent commit with a dirty worktree, so it
attests to the run, not to a committed revision.

The post-review final-contract proof is

It ran fresh matched high-reasoning serial and genuinely concurrent arms over
the same 836 candidates, then regenerated the final prompts and manifests from
the committed implementation byte-for-byte. Both arms produced fifteen truth
origins, seventeen exact quotes, zero unavailable quotes, and no influence
origin. Serial used 248,014 logical tokens and 742,019.840 ms of active provider
time; parallel used 245,176 logical tokens and 389,626.940 ms. The observed
parallel latency reduction was 47.491%. The 1.144% lower parallel logical-token
total is descriptive provider-output variation, not a concurrency token-saving
claim. Both mirrored blind orderings preferred the corrected parallel artifact
to the prior accepted pack. The receipt separately discloses 408,351 logical
tokens across twelve rejected-attempt and judge calls; those are experiment
overhead, not production-arm economics. The receipt's `payload_sha256` is
sha256 over insertion-order compact JSON of the payload, not the repository's
sorted-key `_canonical_json_sha256`; re-derive it that way or a correct receipt
reads as tampered.

The cross-vendor review of that proof measured three facts the arm totals above
do not show, and they are carried here rather than left to the receipt's single
"changed one selected origin" sentence.

First, the two arms disagreed on the relation label for 56 of 836 candidates
(6.7%) despite byte-identical relation prompts and schemas, including eight
direct support/counter polarity flips. One flip reached the displayed pack:
`reddit:1apzs1v:post::batch-0463-unit-0002` carries an identical normalized
meaning and an identical exact quote in both arms, shown as "Matching customer
experience" in the parallel arm and "Differing customer experience" in the
serial arm. Nothing deterministic can detect this, because in positional mode
the reason code is derived from the returned relation and therefore always
agrees with it. Relation labeling, not origin selection, is the least stable
part of this pipeline; treat a repeated selection as evidence of transport
identity, never of relation stability. The measured parallel pack remains the
accepted historical artifact for this hydration workload. New v6 point packs
close the observed display boundary with the separate selected-row confirmation
described above without relabeling the complete candidate set.

Second, `seventeen exact quotes, zero unavailable` counts exactness and
availability, which deterministic code already enforces. It is not a measure of
the context-completeness the v51 contract requires. Measured against that rule,
the final one-call prompt returned 13 of 13 conforming long-body spans in the
parallel arm and 10 of 13 in the serial arm: three serial spans stop mid-phrase
(`…pricey lip balms in`, `…better in this bitter`, `…the very cold winter`), and
the second of those also drops the "bitter cold" condition its own normalized
meaning names. The 220-character ceiling can make start-completeness and
component-completeness jointly unsatisfiable — that same Amazon row needs 222
characters to keep both — and the contract states no precedence, so the adopted
parallel span resolves it by beginning headless (`have tried glossy products…`).

Third, both mirrored judges preferred the parallel artifact, but a blind
preference does not waive an objective omission. The reformulation span omits
the reviewer's explicit recommendation; that is a genuine ceiling residual,
because carrying both the old-formula baseline and the recommendation needs 312
characters. The judge also flagged a Pink Sugar color clause that would fit at
204 characters, but home adjudication did not accept that as a hydration defect:
the color remark neither qualifies nor reverses “feels hydrating and
comfortable,” and forcing it into this axis would add off-axis detail. This
shows that the judge rubric was broader than the contract's materiality rule.
Note also that the judges compared the parallel arm to the prior accepted pack,
never to the serial arm; the choice of parallel over serial rests on measured
latency, not on adjudicated quality.

Of the 47.491% observed latency reduction, 46.528 points are attributable to
concurrency and 0.963 points to net per-call provider variance; concurrency
accounts for 98% of the saving, and the residual variance is why the figure is
reported as observed rather than as a concurrency guarantee.

The current quote stage reads bodies only for selected display rows. V10 copies
every available selected source body in full by deterministic code and types an
absent body unavailable; no quote provider call is made. Historical v9 prompts
render each deduplicated body with stable token
addresses and require each selected row to return only its bound body plus an
inclusive start/end token pair. Deterministic code, not the model, copies the
original contiguous characters. Foreign-body, foreign-token, reversed-span,
and transcription-shaped responses fail before the artifact. The prompt still
uses named selected-row and deduplicated body columns, so
several meanings from one source body do not repeat the entire body. It carries
the deterministic display label, normalized meaning, and same-evidence
companion meanings. For a direct terse response, it also carries only the
parent context IDs already bound to that selected row and the exact referenced
context rows. The parent may supply an omitted premise or referent but never
quote text: artifact `exact_quote` remains a contiguous substring of the child body. The
label is presentation metadata only: a
returned long-source substring must directly express the normalized meaning or
a material companion qualification, or be `quote_unavailable`; a generic
batched relation label cannot make an irrelevant substring acceptable. An
exact span must not start with an unresolved pronoun when nearby preceding text
names its antecedent. Product identity may still
come from the evidence row; the pronoun rule does not require every otherwise
relevant quote to repeat it. The quote is context-complete rather than merely
short: it must substantiate every material outcome, direction, comparator,
formula distinction, and usage or timing condition in the normalized meaning,
retain a nearby material qualification, and never stop mid-phrase. It may
return unavailable only after checking that no contiguous exact span supports
the complete normalized meaning; quote length alone is not a rejection cause. An
available source body of at most 220 characters must be quoted in full, so a
short comment cannot
be clipped before a material qualification or same-source costly behavior. Under
historical v9 token addressing, quoted in full means that body's first token
through its last: a token address cannot name leading or trailing whitespace, so
requiring the raw bytes would leave such a row no finalizable answer at all. For
a longer body, historical v9 asks for the shortest context-complete contiguous
exact substring needed by the meaning, even when it exceeds 220 characters,
after packet and bundle
content verification and evidence-ID, artifact-ID, and source-ref verification,
and rejects a body that changed after the quote manifest was written. When no
contiguous exact span carries the material meaning, the quote response returns
unavailable rather than a misleading fragment. It never repairs text or adds ellipses. An
available quote must contain at least two
Unicode alphanumeric characters; no lexical-overlap relevance rule is applied.
A long-body quote in a historical v4/v5/v6/v7/v8 quote manifest that ends in an alphanumeric
character while the bound source continues with whitespace and another
alphanumeric character fails at
`quote_boundary_incomplete`. This catches a literal substring that stops before
its next source word; it adds no provider retry and makes the incomplete result
visible instead of publishing it. Historical v9 does not apply that prose heuristic:
its deterministic responsibility is exact row/body/token ownership and transfer,
while semantic completeness of an otherwise valid span remains explicitly not
mechanically proven.
A `quote_unavailable` row carries `source_body_present` and a deterministic
cause: `source_body_unavailable` when the body is absent, or
`no_relevant_exact_quote_returned` when a present body yielded no quote.
Available quotes carry a null cause, and the normalized meaning remains in every
case. The completed artifact retains every candidate disposition
and the full candidate-inventory hash, including Amazon or Revolve rows that did
not earn a display slot. Repository runners emit prompts and schemas but make
zero provider calls.

Preserve the source publication time beside every evidence row when the source
exposes it. Current semantic-source builders carry Reddit post/comment
timestamps, Sephora submission times, Amazon review dates, and Revolve review
creation times into packet v3. For a current bundle bound to a materialized
source identity, a missing time stays unavailable and the selection consumer
does not reopen Collection artifacts. A historical bundle without that
identity may rehydrate a missing time only from its exact hash-bound source
artifact; unavailable or unsupported bytes leave the time unavailable and
changed bytes fail.
Source-relative display labels such as `2 months ago` remain literal in the
hash-bound source but are not exact publication times. The selection consumer
maps only that narrow source-relative shape to explicit unavailability; it does
not calculate a date from the run date, and other malformed date strings still
fail closed.
For a multi-product company frontier, each fresh point selection spec takes its
subject-product scope from that exact packet proposition, not from the
company-wide frontier filter. The binding hashes that point-local scope. Axis
membership remains recoverable from the bound semantic rows, but current
authoring admits only the frontier's exact point-relative semantic refs instead
of reopening a product-axis pool for every point. Previously stored unscoped
and axis-expanded bindings remain replayable.
The date enables later descriptive alignment with search trends but does not
establish that either signal caused the other.

New frontier-bound point packs use `phase_a_evidence_quote_manifest_v8`; the
non-frontier relation and batched routes still produce `v6`. Both record the
ordered `provider_selected_ids` subset. The finalizer recomputes that subset
from the bound bodies, rejects drift, deterministically fills short or missing
bodies, and merges provider-returned long-body quotes back into original
selection order. Every selected row requires one customer-facing
`display_label` of at most 80 characters plus
the exact quote; do not add a second paraphrased sentence. The finalizer derives
the label from the already-validated relation `reason_code`; the quote response
returns only quote identity, status, and exact text. The label names the evidence
signal, not its internal relation to the bounded claim. Value examples
include `Repurchase intent despite price`, `Product appeal outweighs price
concern`, `Explicitly worth the price`, `Strong price-to-quantity value`, `Too
little product for the price`, `Performance does not justify the price`, and
`Price prevents repurchase`. A malformed, overlong, or
support/counter/adjacent/exclude-leaking reason code fails closed before display.
V8 also binds the completed pre-selection relation confirmation and requires no
late confirmation attachment during quote finalization. Historical v7 retains
its stamped quote-length ceiling, while historical v6 keeps
its selected-row confirmation attachment; legacy v1 and v3 quote manifests keep
their original all-selected response shape and remain finalizable. The
superseded v2 presentation-statement experiment was scratch-only and is not a
supported historical runtime contract.

Regression note: the exact short comment “Do I cringe a little every time I
remember the price tag? Yes. Will I be repurchasing vanilla AND vanilla beige?
Also yes.” must remain one context-complete quote. The exact comment “They are
kind of expensive for what they are, but the packaging is just so cute I can't
not.” likewise carries price resistance and purchase behavior together. In
both cases, extracting only the price clause reverses or materially weakens the
commercial reading. Weak zero-engagement complaints remain accounted but do
not displace a materially engaged or protected counter merely to fill a lane.
Likewise, a stated time to finish or pan a product is completed-use context, not
quantity efficiency or good value by itself. When the same source explicitly
says it will buy again, package the exact repurchase statement as repurchase
intent and retain the completed-use meaning as same-source context.
The 599-score Strawberry-duo post is the opposite regression shape: its source
body reports a thinner, less-moisturizing formula, disliked scent, and a final
warning not to buy, but its admitted value-axis meanings are gift-card purchase
and trying one variant. Those meanings do not directly judge value, so the post
must remain adjacent to the value box even though it remains useful evidence for
formula, hydration, scent, and general purchase-warning work.

### Experimental route options

The default reconciliation packing remains `input_order`. The opt-in
`advance --reconciliation-packing group_aware_v1` is an unpromoted experiment:
use an isolated run root and keep the option on every resume. Existing groups
guide candidate proximity only; workers still judge the complete candidates
under the same normal/convergence rules and native finalization. This option
does not authorize using selected-group checks as completion.

For the separately commissioned convergence qualification, `advance` accepts
`--reconciliation-authoring-revision exact_identity_namespaces_v5` in a fresh run
root. It exposes source-row aliases by original relation in convergence prompts;
workers must union effective supporting rows, not add per-candidate counts.
Aliases identify rows, not independent people or semantic corroboration. Keep
the revision on every resume. Default v4, validation and retention remain unchanged.

Opt-in `--reconciliation-authoring-revision exact_identity_namespaces_v6`
inherits v5 and clarifies that lack of support is not opposition, and a
finished finding may preserve source uncertainty. It changes prompt guidance
only; defaults and native validation remain unchanged. Keep the same revision
on resume. See the owning semantic integration contract for test status.
The subsequent 121-row comparison stopped on a first-round v6 error that
promoted ownership evidence into purchase support. It did not reach a final
consumer view or qualify adoption; the contract links the preserved evidence.

## Evidence-family boundary

- Reddit/community and retailer reviews are customer evidence and may be
  reconciled here.
- Creator-audience comments may join only when their capture envelope and
  customer role are independently established.
- Owned pages, Meta ads, Google Ads Transparency, and creator-authored campaign
  material remain company-side evidence. They may later be compared with
  customer evidence in a claim-to-response bridge, but they do not corroborate
  a customer experience merely by repeating the same language.
- Campaign conclusions and recommendations belong downstream, not in this
  Phase A structure.

## Proof sequence and current boundary

1. Complete a real bounded cross-source product/axis proof with all selected
   leaves accounted and deterministic wrong-product controls.
2. Freeze and independently review the product binding, semantic method,
   validators, and proof receipt.
3. Prove catalog reach on a real empty-candidate or mixed-product Reddit leaf
   plus retailer evidence, then independently review the runtime change.
4. Bind the final execution route, then run its hash-pinned bounded semantic
   calibration before assigning any remaining full-corpus work. Calibration
   must include a production-shaped work unit, blind atomic gold, selective
   cold repeats, and final-view cross-source obligations; a failure or blocker
   keeps the corpus paused.
5. Only after calibration passes, give cold agents the full assessable Reddit
   and retailer corpus and require exact per-leaf accounting through terminal
   reconciliation and evidence-packet projection.
6. Adopt the current method into a seal-bearing route only through an explicit later
   route revision. A bounded or full shadow run does not rewrite Route 1.6 or
   1.7 obligations.
7. Only after the customer corpus is complete, integrated, reproducible, and
   cold-agent proven should the separate campaign/customer bridge be handed
   off.

As of 2026-08-09, the bounded 300-leaf Summer Fridays proof and the later
four-leaf catalog-reach shadow proof are complete. The latter observed two
empty-candidate Reddit leaves receiving the verified Lip Butter Balm identity
and one real Reddit-plus-Sephora wear stack, while preserving 18
non-equivalent units as unmerged. The first different-vendor pass has been
adjudicated and its material findings closed; a clean closure pass remains due
because the commissioned code-review method was unavailable to that receiver.
The 59,225-leaf full-corpus semantic completion and terminal convergence remain
later observed work, not a current claim.

The run-v3 / bundle-v5 / method-v5 generation is implemented and covered by
repository fixtures and unit tests only. Its structural accounting, version
compatibility, raw-occurrence validation, expansion, lineage, and status
behavior are proven at repository scale; its latency, token, and full-corpus
compatibility effects are not. No measurement against the paused full run's
frozen artifacts has been performed, so the generation carries no latency
claim, no token claim, no full-corpus execution readiness, and no
run-resumption authority. Method v5 has not been semantically calibrated: its
four-way boundary is proven as instructions and routing structure, never as
model recall.

As of 2026-08-10, contract v20 and the no-provider runner implement the bounded
calibration gate. The latest completed Summer Fridays dogfood was v18: 13 of 17
gold cases passed, six of seven selective cold repeats were consistent, all
seven relation obligations passed, and no anomaly warning fired. Four critical
cases still failed through over-splitting, localized unsupported axes, an
inflated contextual favorite, and loss of the bounded ownership-plus-go-to
meaning. The 121-row production-shaped response expanded from 179 v17 units to
260 v18 units, while 235 non-gold units remained outside adjudication-v3's
per-unit checks. This triggers the calibration design's route-change condition:
do not keep accreting prompt examples; test a smaller complexity-balanced
production work-unit shape under unchanged v18 semantics. V18 does not
authorize corpus resumption, estimate defect prevalence, or change the
still-incomplete full-corpus boundary above.

The follow-up v19 architecture probe kept v18 semantic wording and blind gold
unchanged, packed the same 121-row production carrier into near-balanced 61-row
and 60-row prompts, and applied spec v3's compilation-bound audit to the ten
highest-unit-density non-gold rows. Its hash-bound report is
`SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`: 11 of 17 gold cases passed, all seven cold repeats
were materially consistent, and three of ten audited non-gold rows contained
confirmed unsupported or over-split meanings. The split emitted 289 production
units, up from v18's 260. Core and production reconciliation also independently
failed finalization after community evidence was promoted to
`observable_fact`, so no final views existed and all seven relation obligations
remained blocked rather than adjudicated satisfied.

This fires the architecture-probe stop condition. Do not add another prompt
example, delegate a post-pass patch review, resume the 561-prompt corpus, or
claim route readiness from v19. The next decision belongs to selective
verification or a changed execution route that addresses semantic instability
and final-view claim-kind competence; v19 is evidence for that decision, not
authority to implement it.

The bounded v20 direction-adjudication replay isolates one v19 measurement
error without reopening that stop. Contract wording and the generated
adjudication sidecar now distinguish a directly asserted lower comparison
(`A is less moisturising than B`, `affirmed`) from logical negation (`A is not
as moisturising as B`, `negated`). Three fresh read-only adjudications produced
the same 13-of-13 results across five v19 lower comparisons, matched clean
controls, a reversed comparator, a contradicted negation, and a polarity
conflict; those three adjudications were not frozen as durable artifacts, so
that 13-of-13 result is reported, not independently checkable. Re-evaluating
the frozen v19 responses with only the five affected per-unit judgments
corrected removed all five direction failures and raised gold passage from 11
of 17 to 14 of 17. That corrected re-evaluation edited five recorded judgments
rather than re-adjudicating under the generated sidecar, so it measures the
direction rule, not the sidecar's effect on an adjudicator. The result remains
`SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`: three unrelated gold cases still fail, three of
the ten density-audit rows remain confirmed defects, no final views exist, and
all seven relationship obligations remain blocked. This replay is bounded
same-provider evidence, not independent cross-vendor review, prevalence,
readiness, or authority to resume the 561-prompt corpus.

The subsequent architecture adjudication withdrew the proposed polarity
removal and selective whole-row verifier. The five v19 lower-comparison gold
units at issue already used `affirmed` polarity, while the calibration
adjudications disagreed about their direction. The architecture review also
measured the proposed structural selector as nominating at least 73 of 92
claim-bearing
production rows (at least 79.3%) before all candidate triggers were applied,
so it was a near-full reread rather than a selective route. The 92-row
claim-bearing denominator is checkable in the frozen v19 compilation; the
73-row nomination count was not frozen as a durable artifact, so it is
reported, not independently checkable. The retained provisional architecture is
one-pass extraction, deterministic validation, reconciliation-time
source-role/claim-kind competence enforcement, and finalization.

A fresh bounded v20 adjudication-and-reconciliation replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-calibration-v20-replay-20260810-v0`
then exercised that retained route rather than editing v19 judgments. It used
the frozen v19 preparation rather than new v20 extraction prompts, reusing the
preparation identity
`4067e7c51e31ffaf35e51874705a471044833ec506813aa08b0d0699e108531f`,
carried the integrity-checked v20 adjudication sidecar, and used four blind
extraction work units plus crossed and fresh reconciliation readers. The run
made zero model API calls and did not touch the 561-prompt corpus. All judgment
readers were OpenAI-family agents, so this is fresh role separation rather than
cross-vendor semantic proof. Reader blindness, reader crossing, vendor family,
and the zero-API-call condition are operator-reported: replay artifacts do not
record reader identity, reader role, or API-use provenance, so those
operational facts are not independently checkable.

The fresh report remains `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`. It produced 234 primary
semantic units, of which 205 came from the production slice, down from v19's
289 on that same slice; it completed both terminal views, passed 11 of 17 gold
cases, held four of seven cold repeats consistent, satisfied four of seven
relationship obligations, and confirmed two of ten density-audit rows as
defective. All fifty adjudicated statement-direction checks passed, so the five
v19 lower-comparison failures did not recur. The remaining failures are real
and different: unsupported reaction or shade axes, missed narrow preference,
ownership, and go-to atoms, three cold-repeat inconsistencies, and three broken
cross-evidence relationships. The report is bound by
`report_sha256: 36ca06321f537fc12d1b464eb6bc42dfc0711f99f7f107c6219422f6cb8e2a25`;
the observed preparation-to-report wall time was 36.7 minutes.

This fresh replay supersedes the edited 14-of-17 result as the current behavior
observation; it does not erase that earlier direction-rule measurement. Keep
the full corpus paused. The next semantic change, if any, must target a
reproduced remaining defect class and preserve matched clean controls; this
run supplies no authority for a universal second read, polarity redesign,
prompt-example accretion, readiness, prevalence, or corpus resumption.

The method-v6 controlled replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-calibration-v21-replay-20260810-v1`
then exercised the smallest meaning-preservation correction on the same real
calibration carrier: seven semantic-core leaves, 121 production-shaped leaves,
seven selective cold repeats, and both terminal reconciliation views. It kept
the bundle-v5 transport and all downstream schemas unchanged. It corrected the
observed healed-peeling axis, named-shade axis, causal preference reason,
connected ownership-plus-go-to meaning, omitted ownership, sensitive-lip
condition leakage, advertised-balm value, and two surrounding density-audit
defects. It also preserved non-drying as bounded hydration evidence and kept
experienced category separate from value.

The resulting report is `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_PASS`: 17 of 17 gold cases, all
seven selective repeats, all seven relationship obligations, and all ten
production density-audit rows passed with zero blockers and zero hard failures.
The report is bound by
`report_sha256: 414c961fc13fc41de971ee2dca925ff2534cdc19cb06ef6222b17030ef3c02c9`.
All 128 primary leaves remained exactly accounted, terminal views completed,
and no model API was called.

This is a controlled replay, not fresh-reader semantic proof. The v20 response
corpus was the baseline and the affected meanings were corrected under method
v6 before recompilation; cold-repeat uncertainty was also reconciled by the
same operator. The result proves that the new general rules, existing schemas,
compiler, reconciliation, evidence retrieval, and calibration gates can carry
the intended meanings without contradiction. It does not prove that an
independent cold reader will apply the v6 wording unaided, estimate corpus
prevalence, authorize the full-corpus run, or make the route seal-ready. Keep
the full corpus paused until the code change receives de-correlated review and
a fresh blind v6 reader reproduces the bounded result or exposes the next real
defect class.

The delegated v6 code review then found a real ambiguity in those instructions:
the retained v5 rule forbade bundled mixed directions while the v6 appendix
said to keep every explicit contrast together. Home adjudication accepted that
finding and the delegate's method-hash pin. It clarified that contrast and
qualification still obey atomicity, corrected the stale bundle-v5 error text,
and documented that calibration may deliberately retarget the same hash-pinned
source evidence to the spec-selected method; the exact method hash in the route
fingerprint makes that a visible comparison, not a fallback.

Fresh blind dogfood did not reproduce the controlled pass. The first corrected
read at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-calibration-v21-review-fix-20260810-v3`
accounted all 128 primary leaves, completed both terminal views, and satisfied
all seven cross-source relations, but passed only 14 of 17 gold cases and five
of seven cold repeats. It exposed missing same-attribute comparison, shade-axis,
texture-versus-formula, exact-product nickname, and logical-negation behavior.
A compact general correction addressed those classes without adding a field,
second read, product phrase table, or extra production-shaped prompt.

The resulting fresh blind run at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-calibration-v21-review-fix-20260810-v4`
again accounted 7/7 semantic-core and 121/121 production-shaped leaves, used
the original two production prompts (largest 89,904 bytes), completed terminal
reconciliation, and satisfied all seven relation obligations. It passed 16 of
17 gold cases, four of seven cold repeats, and seven of ten density audits. The
one remaining gold failure split weeks-long peeling from repeated-use worsening
instead of preserving their causal relationship. The cold repeat also
over-decomposed two dense rows and miscredited one reported deterrent; three
other dense production rows retained polarity or comparison defects. The
evaluator therefore returned `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`, with report hash
`74009baaedadc3e5e170012586b383179f2d1b60664bc211015187321f0e1ae3`.

This is useful negative proof: the compact general rules corrected all five
defect classes they targeted, but one-pass prompt wording alone has not produced
stable calibration behavior. Do not resume the full corpus, claim method-v6
readiness, or keep accreting case-like prompt clauses. The next decision must
address selective semantic verification or another bounded consistency
mechanism against these preserved fresh failures; it remains separate from any
campaign bridge, Deliver conclusion, prevalence estimate, or seal adoption.

A final bounded fidelity correction then separated calibration-ruler defects
from reader defects. It made asserted desires affirmative, prohibited a nearby
preference from inventing an axis, reason, or comparison, allowed different
supported atomic decompositions in the cold repeat, allowed one reply to carry
both attributed parent claims and its own shopping reaction, and split the
retailer peeling gold into its two independently supported facts. These are
general meaning rules; they add no field, second read, example table, or new
production work unit.

The fresh blind run at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-calibration-v21-review-fix-20260810-v5`
used method hash
`9ff5c8a8be460ef2b599d08ec08485ebbd698ef12ad2db9eb9cf8bad38090805`,
kept the two production-shaped prompts (largest 89,958 bytes), accounted all
7/7 semantic-core and 121/121 production-shaped leaves, and completed both
terminal views. The pigment defect was absent: the desire for more pigment kept
affirmed direction. The original-Glossier row changed shape but did not close
its defect class. It no longer bundled an unsupported `less hydrating than`
degree claim with the supported `not the most hydrating` statement, so its
density adjudication moved from confirmed defect to benign. It still emits
`reddit:13aw1sp:jj95w9s::u081`, which turns the nearby Glossier preference into
a hydration comparison. The blind adjudicator accepted the parenthetical as a
link; owner adjudication treats it as insufficient to establish the comparison.
All seven relation obligations also held.

The run still returned `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`. The deterministic report
passed 15 of 17 gold cases, five of seven cold repeats, and eight of ten density
audits; its canonical report hash is
`b3e1477c4596fc0da38fbc9e048ba64f8e2519b357e06072262f16877a724a26`.
The remaining failures are different classes: one direct scent answer was
miscast as agreement, a non-repurchase unit inherited a neighboring shade axis,
one cold read preserved a material balm-value observation the primary omitted,
and a production row invented a two-product per-use comparison from a one-sided
quantity statement. Preserve this run as proof that the requested correction
worked and that method-v6 is still not ready for the full corpus. Do not turn
these residuals into more case-specific prompt clauses; route them through the
planned selective semantic verification decision.

The delegated review also found that v5 changed the adjudication instructions
without changing their self-declared `v1` version. The v5 sidecar hash is
`9b6459531ffe20280a087b1ef254f7302a5ee7d63e1a0efa0533a53fac7562af`,
while the earlier preserved runs use
`5fd4aeeafa278291943dc6316fe91a8f6b51a79c69f734dc0d29bb63d4286a49`;
neither `preparation_receipt.json` nor `report.json` stores that ruler hash.
Therefore
the score deltas between those runs cannot be attributed solely to the semantic
method. Freeze the preserved reports under their exact sidecars. Before another
calibration, version the revised ruler and persist its full hash in both the
preparation receipt and final report; do not rewrite the existing report hashes.

The production-shaped prompt also finished only 42 bytes below its 90,000-byte
ceiling. No further method-text growth should use that preserved slice without
an explicit repacking or ceiling decision, because the next small change may
turn two prompts into three and end direct prompt-shape comparability.

Contract v22 closes the ruler-lineage defect for future calibration without
rewriting history. Preparation v2 and report v2 now carry
`semantic_calibration_adjudication_contract_v2` plus full SHA-256
`186a0022397d35ca5ee6a464742155a6e55e606d1ad0da636611d404c838ab78`.
Evaluation accepts only that ruler and the two exact preserved v1 sidecar
hashes; an unknown or receipt-mismatched sidecar fails closed. Re-evaluating the
preserved v5 run through the new code reproduced its report-v1 object and
canonical hash
`b3e1477c4596fc0da38fbc9e048ba64f8e2519b357e06072262f16877a724a26`
exactly. A fresh preparation-v2 proof at
`C:\tmp\forseti-calibration-ruler-v2-proof-20260810` wrote the same ruler ID and
hash into both its receipt and report; with no new adjudication, it correctly
stopped at `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_BLOCKED`. This proof changes no extraction
method or prompt and grants no full-corpus resume authority.

Contract v23 adds the smallest complete independent whole-row check between
primary extraction and reconciliation. Run v5 selects method v7. Every primary
claim-bearing evidence row receives exactly one `accept`, complete-row
`replace`, or `unresolved` decision against its leaf and supplied context.
Replacements pass through the ordinary semantic validator; non-claim rows pass
through unchanged. The compiler preserves the original raw-response manifest,
binds the verifier responses separately, and gives reconciliation exactly one
active result. Method v7 fails closed at reconciliation and finalization when
that verification manifest is absent or invalid. The extraction wording and
transport schemas remain unchanged from method v6.

The final fresh blind Summer Fridays dogfood at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v1-20260810-v3` checked all 91
claim-bearing rows from the preserved 121-leaf production-shaped compilation.
It packed six verifier prompts, the largest 89,720 bytes under the 90,000-byte
ceiling, and made no model API call. The independent readers returned 43
accepts, 47 complete-row replacements, and one unresolved row. The runner
rejected no hidden partial result and wrote a 264-unit active compilation with
`compilation_sha256:
7d04a4bcd827f7d9d1f01fcbadca806e1c7a923badc7e8ec78281ff285386a95`.
The same persisted compilation then prepared reconciliation successfully as two
prompts with 264 candidates; its stage hash is
`55ed039e170fbeef7cbd5db61bf441816194f2102214e46d3185a0580892df62`.

The blind pass corrected five of the six preserved residual rows: it removed
hydration borrowed by unqualified Glossier/Laneige preferences, made the short
Cherry-scent answer first-hand, removed shade-fit from ownership and repurchase,
kept the pigment desire affirmed, restored omitted sale purchases, and removed
the invented two-product per-use quantity comparison. It also preserved the
important boundary that an actual named-shade favorite may use
`shade_and_color_fit` while ownership or repurchase alone may not. The one
unresolved row stayed out of the active semantic units rather than being forced
into a claim.

One material semantic residual remains visible. On
`reddit:13aw1sp:jj8kde7`, this final reader accepted the proposed row even though
it omitted the parent-linked negative judgment that the product was not really
worth $24 when judged as a balm and retained sensitivity as a hydration
condition. Earlier independent reads and a final targeted cold check did catch
the omitted value meaning, so the representation and replacement path can carry
the correction; the repeated disagreement proves that one verifier read is not
a perfect completeness oracle. Do not hide this with more case-shaped prompt
clauses or treat the row-verification pass as semantic readiness. It is a
material quality improvement and a fail-closed integration boundary, not a
replacement for bounded semantic calibration. The real dogfood reused the
preserved method-v6 bundle to test the new optional pass; focused tests prove
that method v7 makes the pass mandatory. No full-corpus run, prevalence claim,
Deliver conclusion, seal, or resume authority follows.

The different-vendor patch review then found two mechanical gaps in the v7
claim. First, the legacy flat finalizer did not call the v7 verification gate;
it now carries the same fail-closed check as the staged and v3 finalizers.
Second, the manifest bound the active evidence-ID list but not the active row
content. It could therefore be copied from an honest verified compilation onto
different dispositions and semantic units over the same bundle. Contract v23
now binds `active_rows_sha256` over both active dispositions and semantic units,
and every consumer recomputes it before accepting the compilation. Malformed
manifest-bearing compilations now raise a controlled semantic error rather than
a raw missing-key exception.

The fresh blind readings remain preserved unchanged under the `v3` dogfood
root. A deterministic post-review re-derivation at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v1-20260810-v4` reused that exact
stage and the same six verifier responses; no semantic row was reread or edited.
The 43/47/1 decisions, 264 semantic units, evidence dispositions, and original
raw-response manifest are object-identical to `v3`. Only the strengthened
manifest and its downstream identities changed. The current verified
compilation hash is
`694015e53ea96188a56dcef9c4cca95272ed42a13230956d802543a3c26603eb`,
its active-row-content hash is
`ab178a2f8a16be8716e51131bc85b787707089af8d8b8a5cdd1b91e7b9e1a0b7`,
and the resulting two-prompt reconciliation stage hash is
`6e962e4d9640353df0e144eaa451e02603fa06115722c27eedcc2152ea48d223`.
The earlier `7d04a4bc...` compilation and `55ed039e...` stage remain historical
pre-content-binding receipts; current code correctly refuses to treat their old
manifest shape as sufficient v7 verification.

Contract v24 keeps the same whole-row verification architecture and versions
its verifier method to v2. The change is deliberately procedural: before
checking axes or other fields, the reader privately reconstructs every
standalone meaning, preserves simultaneous positive and negative judgments,
and maps each material meaning to a proposed unit. Later context may qualify an
earlier answer but cannot erase it without an explicit withdrawal. Every field
must remain supported by the source or supplied context. A customer attribute
conditions a result only when it states or unambiguously entails the same
baseline or the source explicitly scopes that result to it. A possible bias,
caveat, or different product response stays a separate meaning, and a conjoined
attribute phrase splits so that only the part whose baseline the result reports
qualifies it. Sensitivity alone establishes no moisture baseline; product-linked
sensitivity remains reaction/tolerance context, while dry or dehydrated context
may qualify moisture. The private inventory adds no response field, parser,
extra worker, or Deliver judgment. Verifier-v1 stages remain historical
artifacts rather than being silently replayed under the new method text.

The verifier-v2 calibration used the preserved 121-leaf Summer Fridays
production-shaped compilation. An initial full blind pass at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v2-20260810-v0` checked all 91
claim-bearing rows in six prompts and compiled 35 accepts, 54 complete-row
replacements, two unresolved rows, and 285 active semantic units with no model
API calls. It restored the omitted `reddit:13aw1sp:jj8kde7` judgment that the
product was not worth $24 as a balm, but still attached sensitivity to hydration.
That near-miss kept the calibration open rather than allowing prompt structure
or a valid compilation to stand in for semantic success.

The final bounded repeat at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v2-20260810-v5` used method hash
`037ac8e7256cda9ffce258cab0738ff76b2395bf1ec666217419f068a6901faa`.
Its full 91-row preparation still packed into six prompts under the existing
90,000-byte ceiling; the largest was 89,787 bytes. Three fresh blind readers
then independently checked the same real three-row boundary. All three restored
the balm-value judgment, kept the hydration result condition-free, and preserved
sensitivity as a separate reaction/tolerance meaning. All three retained very
dry lips as the hydration baseline on `reddit:13aw1sp:jj93sc5`; all retained
natural wrinkles as the smoothing baseline on `reddit:13aw1sp:jj9vrbp`, while
one of the three also carried lip dryness into that smoothing condition.
The final targeted responses were fresh-read for exact row order, complete
replacement shape, statements, and conditions. This proves the bounded semantic
boundary and production prompt packing, not a completed final-method 91-row
submission, semantic readiness, full-corpus resume, prevalence, Deliver, or seal.

The delegated code review then treated that one-of-three dryness carryover as a
live attribute-overbinding residual rather than a settled reader difference:
the leaf conjoins dryness and wrinkles in one attribute phrase, and only
wrinkles report the smoothing result's baseline. Home adjudication accepted the
attribute split, generalized non-cancellation to any later context, and required
every returned field to remain supported rather than restoring a long field
checklist.

The adjudicated replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v2-20260810-v6` used method hash
`0172f560dd83a6f866842c06473d35f9f79633a5e71bf17a84ca95546f08affb` and stage
hash `b6d35dd65da16e19b9ded1590d3eec06d3da44f30e61c70638c959e5147f0797`.
A fresh production preparation again covered all 91 claim-bearing rows in six
prompts; the largest rendered prompt was 89,909 bytes under the unchanged
90,000-byte ceiling. Three new blind readers then received the same real
three-row boundary through the actual renderer. All three restored the
balm-value judgment, left hydration free of sensitivity, retained sensitivity
as separate reaction/tolerance context, retained very dry lips only for the
hydration comparison, and retained natural wrinkles—but not dryness—for the
smoothing result. Their persisted JSON passed fresh checks for exact row order,
complete replacement shape, statements, axes, and conditions.

This remains a bounded semantic proof, not a completed final-method 91-row
response submission, semantic readiness, full-corpus resume, prevalence,
Deliver, or seal. One separate architecture residual also remains: applying row
verification refuses a mismatched stage, but a later reconciliation consuming a
stored verified compilation does not itself embed or re-derive the verifier
method identity. That provenance hardening is not part of this semantic-method
fix.

Contract v25 closes that stored-compilation residual with
`semantic_evidence_row_verification_manifest_v2`. The active compilation now
carries the verifier method version and exact method-text SHA-256 inside the
manifest hash; every current reconciliation/finalization entry point re-checks
both. A legacy-v1, missing, substituted, or rehashed mismatched binding fails
closed and must replay row verification. This changes only the manifest schema;
the verifier stage, response, prompt, and semantic method stay unchanged.

The same 91-row production-shaped input was also repacked without executing new
semantic responses to measure the prompt-size tradeoff. A 90,000-byte ceiling
uses 6 prompts and 488,963 total rendered bytes; 60,000 uses 11 and 635,473;
50,000 uses 17 and 811,285; 45,000 uses 23 and 987,097; 40,000 uses 37 and
1,397,325; and 37,500 uses 50 and 1,778,251. One-row prompts range from 31,375
to 37,216 bytes, so 37,500 is the current corpus's mechanical floor and 35,000
cannot carry every row. The successful final three-row blind replay rendered at
43,757 bytes, making 45,000 the smallest semantically evidenced operating
candidate. It is not yet the full-corpus default: it roughly doubles prompt
bytes versus 90,000 and still needs the complete 91-row semantic replay to
measure quality and latency under that packing.

Contract v27 keeps the one-reader whole-row architecture and versions its
verifier method to v3. A customer attribute excluded from a result's structured
conditions must also disappear from that result's sentence. When the source
separately links the excluded attribute to another product response, that
separate meaning remains evidence instead of disappearing with the neighboring
condition. Calibration can now grade an explicitly supplied verified
compilation, but only after rebuilding its primary compilation and proving that
the verifier manifest cites that exact input and preserves its raw-response
lineage. Method-v7 calibration fails closed when no verified compilation is
supplied. When cold repeat is configured, its raw responses pass through the
same row-verification application and exact-input lineage check under the
reserved `cold-repeat` slice id; method v7 therefore compares verified primary
rows only with verified repeat rows.

The final boundary replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-row-verification-v3-boundary-20260811-v1`
rendered the same three real Summer Fridays rows in one 44,047-byte prompt. All
three fresh blind readers preserved lip sensitivity as its own product-linked
reaction, excluded sensitivity from hydration, retained very dry lips as the
hydration baseline, and retained natural wrinkles—but not dryness—as the
smoothing baseline. This closed the repeated statement-versus-condition leak
without adding a second standing verifier, case-specific field, parser, or
provider call.

The complete 91-row replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-final-v3-50k-20260811-v1` then used a
50,000-byte verifier ceiling. The final method text packed 91 claim-bearing rows
into 18 prompts, with a 49,674-byte largest prompt and 846,131 rendered bytes in
total. Three blind workers returned 37 accepts, 54 complete-row replacements,
and zero unresolved verification decisions. The active compilation contains
278 semantic units and has `compilation_sha256:
c90fd3a7fdc4addffa2aac905ad9a7964301ace0985985543b5852f2ce627230`.
The five previously load-bearing rows now preserve the settled boundaries: the
balm-value judgment and separate sensitivity reaction survive; sensitivity does
not enter hydration; dryness does not enter smoothing; ownership and repurchase
do not borrow shade fit; and the Ole Henriksen comparison does not invent a
Summer Fridays quantity claim.

Reconciliation completed in four levels over 25 observed minutes from verifier
preparation to final view. A level-one competence correction demoted six
community-authored observable statements from established facts to non-terminal
attributed evidence; their meaning and provenance remained available. The
terminal `semantic_evidence_integration_view_v2` accounts for all 121 captured
items, contains 10 consolidated propositions—nine independently repeated and
one resonance-supported—plus 242 distinct unmerged semantic units, and keeps
three source leaves explicitly unresolved. Its
`view_sha256` is
`701602c002fdc056b4faf7cdae7f2efc7024462feaf8b05a4f6208be6e105a51`.
The 161-plus-1 split at reconciliation level three is an observed latency
inefficiency, not a semantic omission or a reason to mutate the route inside
this proof.

What that run does not establish is the new calibration gate itself. Its bundle
is `semantic_evidence_integration_method_v6`, recorded as `method_version` on
the terminal view, so the method-v7 fail-closed path above has unit coverage
only and no real-run evidence. The same lineage carries a second gap the run
cannot close: because row verification is permitted but not required below v7,
this exact v6 lineage can still be graded on its unverified primary compilation
by omitting the verified-compilation root, and the calibration report records
only a compilation hash, never which of the two it graded.

This completes the production-shaped 121-leaf batch's accounted semantic path;
it does not yet authorize the 59,225-leaf corpus. The existing calibration gold
predates the settled attribute, ownership-axis, and comparison boundaries, so a
fresh adjudication must grade this exact verified compilation and its terminal
view before the full corpus resumes. The run makes no prevalence, Deliver,
campaign, seal, or readiness claim.

Contract v28 keeps the same single whole-row verifier and versions only its
method text to v4. The verifier now treats replacement as a correction of the
proposed row rather than an invitation to rewrite it from scratch: supported
meanings, axes, product bindings, conditions, posture, and direction stay unless
the source justifies a named correction. It also aligns drying and non-drying
with hydration, records named-shade or all/every-shade ownership as
shade-specific behavior, records an expressly sale-conditioned future purchase
as value evidence, and prevents a statement solely about a comparator from becoming a
Summer Fridays statement. At finalization, method-v7 personal agreement may
support the meaning but cannot count as another independent first-hand customer.
Historical verifier-v3 receipts remain identifiable but require replay before
current reconciliation, and historical semantic views rebuild exactly.

The bounded v28 dogfood reuses the frozen v27 extraction responses so the test
isolates the verifier and claim-support changes. Its fresh prompts use a
50,000-byte ceiling and cover semantic-core, cold-repeat, and the complete
production-shaped verification slice. This replay is calibration evidence only;
it does not authorize the full corpus until its blind responses validate and a
fresh adjudication passes the existing gate.

The final-hash replay is recorded at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-verifier-v4-dogfood-20260811-v1`.
It checked all 103 claim-bearing rows: 86 were accepted, 17 received bounded
complete-row corrections, none were unresolved, and all three verified
compilations validated with zero model API calls. The verifier corrected drying
without moving peeling out of reaction, kept customer sensitivity separate from
hydration conditions, retained all/every-shade behavior, added value only when
future purchase was expressly sale- or price-conditioned, and removed
comparator-only target bindings. The current compilation hashes are
`a4a56aaf2400ffe670cf1f1d45f1569a22ad3bcbacfbd25eed6a8a68e8e09a47`
for semantic core,
`dd5d70e7a88273c737b194c02709bfe2a80bbc2b5c9e014cef073cab05592a41`
for cold repeat, and
`d85142112dc2850cf98fd39278046a9efc7a59f3ac5ea7515a6cdf78ba9f046e`
for the production-shaped slice.

Reconciliation accounts for all 7 core and 121 production-shaped items. The
core view contains 25 propositions and retains two echo-only meanings as
unmerged attribution (`view_sha256:
b37be3fdaeccf2f17f7332ac850d152bf31c0689ebff5313ef340b738fe45fed`).
The production view contains 17 genuinely stacked propositions and preserves
202 distinct meanings explicitly as unmerged retrieval evidence rather than
manufacturing consensus (`view_sha256:
82e530edc20be48cc78cdfc76fb197612cdc537ca32eaf20cf47d89bde1c3121`).

Fresh blind adjudication remains `SEMANTIC_CALIBRATION_FAIL`: 15 of 17 gold
cases pass, all 7 relation obligations are satisfied, 4 of 7 cold repeats are
consistent, and all 10 density rows are benign. The remaining semantic defects
are one omitted target-versus-Lanolips moisture comparison and one primary row
that invents a product-linked sensitivity reaction; the latter also creates an
eighth unit beyond the ruler's 4..7 range. Three cold cases remain inconsistent.
The evaluator separately reports `PREPARATION_RECEIPT_MISMATCH` even though the
rebound receipt and stored spec bind the same `spec_sha256`; that mechanical
residual is not hidden or counted as semantic success. Full-corpus execution
therefore remains paused.

Contract v29 installs the smallest general correction for those remaining
semantic defects without adding another verifier. The active verifier-v5 method
now performs one final source-to-unit completeness check, preserves an explicit
same-dimension relational comparison separately from its side observations,
and requires an explicit bound-product link before turning a nearby customer
attribute into a product response. It also keeps supported adjacent-product
meanings under their own subject. Historical verifier-v4 results remain evidence
about the prior method and must not be relabelled. A fresh blind verifier-v5
replay and adjudication still owe proof; until that run passes, the full corpus
remains paused and the independent preparation-receipt mismatch remains open.

The fresh verifier-v5 row replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-verifier-v5-dogfood-20260811-v0`
proved both targeted corrections at the row boundary: all 40 required gold
meanings were present, including the missing hydration comparison, and the
sensitive-lips row returned seven supported meanings without inventing a
product-caused sensitivity reaction. A blind precheck found 16 of 17 strict
gold rows, 6 of 7 cold repeats, and 9 of 10 density rows clean. The strict gold
miss is a stale ruler boundary: its scent-causal named-shade preference allowed
only `scent_and_flavor`, while the settled named-shade rule also requires
`shade_and_color_fit`. Verifier v5 nevertheless remains insufficient because
one reader made two partially ambiguous rows wholly unresolved, one cold repeat
broadened shade-specific sale intent to the product family, and one density row
lost an explicit overall positive evaluation.

Contract v30 versions the same verifier to v6 for those general residuals.
Local ambiguity may no longer erase independently safe meanings; ambiguous
variant and echo meanings stay bounded without guessing; variant-specific
behavior cannot broaden to the family; and explicit overall evaluations remain
separate. Verifier-v5 artifacts remain preserved as negative proof. A fresh
blind v6 replay, corrected gold-ruler binding, terminal reconciliation, and
formal adjudication remain required before full-corpus execution resumes.

That blind row replay is recorded at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-verifier-v6-dogfood-20260811-v0`.
All 103 rows compiled under verifier-v6 with zero unresolved decisions and zero
model API calls. Both original defects remain corrected, both formerly dropped
ambiguous rows retain their safe meanings, and all 40 required gold meanings are
present. The strict stored ruler reports 15 of 17 cases, but both disagreements
conflict with settled doctrine: the named-shade favorite correctly carries
`shade_and_color_fit` beside its scent reason, and an explicit overall favorite
reaction remains evidence rather than disappearing. On the settled rules the
gold meanings are 17 of 17. Cold repeat is 4 of 7 field-exact; two additional
pairs preserve the same propositions with only asserted-versus-qualified drift.
The apparent Poppy-specific broadening was later found to be a ruler error, not
a semantic regression: the parent asks whether the product range is worth USD 24,
while Poppy identifies the option the customer owns.
The density audit is 9 of 10 clean and finds one omitted material conversion
context. These residuals show that more verifier prompt wording is no longer the
smallest correct move: the governing rules are already present but one-pass
readers apply them unevenly. Keep full-corpus execution paused pending an
architecture decision on semantic disagreement/coverage handling, a corrected
hash-bound ruler, and the still-open preparation-receipt mismatch.

Verifier v7 corrects that referent-scope error without adding a variant catalog.
It resolves pronouns and evaluation scope from the whole exchange, retains the
named option as a separate ownership or experience meaning, and does not
automatically narrow later product-level judgments to that option. In two fresh
blind rounds, all three readers selected a product-level sale judgment; after a
completeness clarification, all three also retained Poppy ownership, sale value,
switching, smoothing failure, and no-repurchase evidence. This bounded check
does not resume the full corpus or close the other recorded residuals.

The four-comment verifier-v7 delta at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-delta-v1-20260811-v0` confirmed the
referent-scope correction: independent reads retained Poppy as ownership context
while keeping the sale-only judgment at product scope, and both retained the
skin-tint conversion context. It also exposed two narrower verifier residuals:
one verifier reused reaction susceptibility as a hydration condition, and one
lost the value meaning of explicit product waste through an application tool.
Contract v32 versions the verifier to v8 with those two general clarifications.
The bounded blind replay at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-semantic-verifier-v8-delta-20260812-v0`
applied verifier v8 independently to the primary and cold compilations. Both
stages bind method hash
`96237f5b5a407727f2ee338e9c6838a577e91de6ceb609d165d6906b437dabd8`.
Both verified outputs left hydration unconditioned by sensitivity, retained
explicit sponge/product loss under `value_and_quantity`, and completed with zero
unresolved rows. The runner accepted both full verified compilations:
`bd14adcf131ddfbd630b75fd64778e7869d6984da5c6588e77b85d47147ca567`
for primary (36 active units, 0 accept / 4 replace / 0 unresolved) and
`f387ac008c345a252dcafd705a3a9cad849402a0e5a9a05f875884706d2148cf`
for cold (32 active units, 1 accept / 3 replace / 0 unresolved), with zero model
API calls. The two legs differ on the separability half of the new value rule:
the primary leg carried the sponge product-loss meaning as its own unit, while
the cold leg kept it fused with the thin-texture and tool meanings in a single
three-axis unit. That axis retention is proven on both legs; independent
separation is proven on the primary leg only. This closes the two-comment
verifier boundary at axis retention; no historical result is relabelled and the
replay alone does not claim full-corpus completion.

Contract v33 adds an opt-in reconciliation-policy v2 without changing semantic
method v7, its extraction prompts, or its mandatory row-verification artifacts.
The policy is selected once when preparing the first reconciliation level and
is then carried in each validator-produced node compilation. Reconciliation
node keys are local to their prompt batch; compiler identity continues to
combine the stage, batch, and local key, so identical local handles in different
responses cannot collide. Normal mode must retain every valid first-hand or
personal-agreement customer finding as a semantic node, including a one-row
finding. After a completed normal level removes less than one percent of its
input candidates, the next level enters convergence mode. Convergence prompts
receive only the compiler-counted number of distinct supporting evidence rows:
a one-row finding stays retained as unmerged retrieval evidence, while a
candidate or exact-equivalence merge spanning more than one source row must
remain a node. The validator enforces all three boundaries independently of the
prompt and preserves exact child accounting. Historical preparation without
the policy remains byte-stable; the completed verified method-v7 compilation
can therefore be replayed under the new reconciliation policy without
re-extraction or row re-verification.

“Removes less than one percent” includes a valid normal level that temporarily
expands because one input candidate must attach to multiple distinct bounded
meanings. That expansion enters convergence; it is not rejected or hidden by
discarding one of the meanings.

Once convergence begins, each incoming candidate is already one bounded
meaning. It therefore has one destination: one retained attachment or one
unmerged retrieval reason. Normal mode remains the place where a compound
candidate may be split; convergence must not recreate that ambiguity.

Convergence also ends placeholder circulation. Every emitted node is terminal.
An incoming terminal finding with repeated source-row support remains attached;
an incoming nonterminal candidate either supports a terminal bounded finding or
stays recoverable as explicitly unmerged evidence. It must not be relabelled
merely to finish, and it must not return as another nonterminal placeholder.
The compiler carries the prior node's terminal status into the next immutable
stage so the schema can distinguish those two retention duties.

After a complete convergence pass returns one node per input but leaves some
nonterminal placeholders, the next stage hash-binds and carries the already
terminal nodes whose leaf evidence is outside the nonterminal candidates'
transitive overlap neighborhood. Only the nonterminal candidates and terminal
neighbors connected to them by shared leaf evidence return to the model. This
is not a new semantic decision: the carried nodes already survived the complete
fixed-count pass and cannot affect the bounded remainder, while the remaining
evidence is still accounted as terminal output or explicit unmerged retrieval
material.

Axis membership is mechanical lineage, not reconciliation judgment. Current
decision reconciliation derives each node's axis IDs from its attached children,
and the final consumer rederives them from the verified leaf rows in the root
batch compilation. A provider-authored axis string cannot add, remove, or move a
finding between axes.

When an explicitly retired candidate shares a leaf with a surviving finding,
the leaf's final disposition is `used`, never both `used` and `unmerged`. The
retired candidate still counts in convergence input accounting; its source row
remains recoverable through the surviving finding.

A convergence pass is terminal when every surviving candidate remains a
terminal node and the pass produces exactly as many nodes plus explicitly
unmerged input candidates as it received candidates. This fixed-point rule may
span multiple prompt-bounded batches:
prompt byte size is a transport constraint, not a semantic requirement to
invent another merge. Historical reconciliation without policy v2 retains its
single-batch terminal rule.

The full-corpus policy-v2 replay reused the existing verified method-v7
compilation and reached a fixed point at level 8. The terminal compilation has
107 repeated findings supported by 320 semantic units; 7,700 one-off or
otherwise non-converged units remain explicitly retrievable, so all 8,020
captured semantic units are accounted exactly once. The finalized view accounts
all 60,901 captured corpus items (59,225 semantically assessed and 1,676
mechanically excluded), reports zero blocked items, and preserves the 96
explicitly unresolved evidence rows. Its stored view SHA-256 is
`b50dda4370b2c98ce4ac2553aa9c2cb84b5cb23f1c91fa55567c7f9607b31c42`.

Contract v34 does not relabel that policy-v2 replay. It adds a separate opt-in
route that closes relations before one-row findings are retired. Deterministic
block pairs cover every unordered pair on one terminal normal-retention
frontier exactly once. Prompt batches remain transport only: equivalent pair
decisions form transitive classes across partitions, and opposed pair decisions
form symmetric links between classes. Directional identity comes from a
deterministically selected truth-complete frontier assertion and excludes axes,
stage, batch, and local handles. Finalization requires a hash-bound decision for
every required pair, with zero unresolved pairs, and writes view v3; missing
coverage cannot appear as `none_observed`.

That v34 route is experimental rather than operational. On 2026-08-13, a dated
operator read of
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-full-corpus-v8-20260812-v0\reconciliation-policy-v2\level-0002\node_compilation.json`
(raw-file SHA-256
`23b417fde1de678379fabf54ea50fdcaaac7b8e0811b5d21c4227d53c40b7d75`;
stored `node_compilation_sha256`
`344e38ac29c0dbe27af397271ed0657b96b983e87e4b679f318cd8ba5311c473`)
observed 7,076 semantic nodes and 780 carried unmerged units. A read-only name
scan of that run root observed no relation-closure output. Those statements are
operator observations scoped to that exact path and date, not repository-backed
universal absence proof. Exhaustive preparation at that scale would require
millions of decisions, so v34 must not be run, treated as completion, or used to
claim global identity, global opposition coverage, or `none_observed` for that
frontier. Structural finalization guards reject internally inconsistent closure
schema, candidate membership, all-pairs identity, and coverage cardinality, but
remain containment rather than semantic proof against a coherently forged whole
artifact.

The supported completed path for normal Forseti intelligence cycles remains:
full-corpus extraction -> mandatory row verification -> policy-v2 normal
reconciliation -> convergence/retention under the existing supported policy ->
the supported view/output. Preserve one-off and unresolved evidence honestly;
absence of v34 closure never converts into `none_observed`. Registry-first
global identity, embeddings/top-k retrieval, deterministic blocking, and
exhaustive all-pairs closure are deferred research directions. Agents must not
explore or implement them unless an owner explicitly reopens architecture work
because a measured customer or intelligence outcome is materially harmed by
duplicate meaning identity or missing global opposition. On that trigger,
reorient first to the semantic integration contract's "Supported operating
route and owner-only reopen boundary" and then this workflow for current run
history; otherwise continue the supported policy-v2 path.

When closure exposes a bad source-row decomposition or mixed logical polarity,
`prepare-row-repair` projects only the named evidence rows through the existing
complete-row verifier. `submit-row-repair` preserves every other active row,
writes explicit repair lineage, and changes the verified compilation hash.
Every prior reconciliation and view then fails stale-lineage validation and
must be regenerated. When a completed old policy-v2 terminal compilation is
available, run `migrate-repaired-terminal` before commissioning a full replay.
That no-provider operation is admissible only when it can prove complete
old/new leaf equality for every reused node, preserve exact unmerged membership,
and deterministically rederive every changed dependency under the semantic
contract's narrow polarity-only rule. It writes a new terminal compilation and
separate hash-bound manifest; it never edits or rebinds an old response. A
statement, scope, condition, posture, membership, relation, or lineage change
outside that proof rejects locally and returns the operator to fresh policy-v2
reconciliation. Run `finalize-v3` and evidence-packet projection only against
the repaired verified compilation plus the new migrated terminal compilation.
The route does not permit direct edits to node compilations or finalized views.

The owner-authorized Summer Fridays repair successor at
`C:\tmp\forseti-summer-fridays-polarity-repair-replay-20260817-v0\incremental-terminal-migration-v9`
exercised that exact route with zero provider calls. Complete-row repair changed
five semantic units: three proposition-linked overhyped rows changed polarity,
while two additional meanings from the same repaired evidence rows changed but
retained their exact unmerged membership. Those two memberships and their prior
reasons were preserved rather than freshly adjudicated against the repaired
meanings; a consumer needing that stronger claim must use fresh reconciliation.
The migration reused 106 of 107 old terminal nodes, invalidated and rederived
one, and coalesced two compatible
exact-identity groups into 105 unique terminal nodes. It preserved 320 terminal
leaf relations, 7,700 unmerged units, 8,020 total semantic units, 96 unresolved
evidence rows, and all 60,901 captured/accounted items. The full packet also
preserved the selected legacy source-native engagement observations instead of
converting them to unavailable: 3,215 Reddit rows retained their literal score
state and 132 retailer rows retained their literal positive-helpful count,
with no inferred values. Stored hashes are
`3682244e87a8b305f882794575b0fa77f55ef77220c0545b8058eb899388be15`
for the successor node compilation,
`61dcbfc4b2426e131b56392c83d10a9096f96ef209c791bcf5552554f2d2f37a`
for its migration manifest,
`865dd68cd3c56e13e1369a4c8ef798ac4d3ae6ff36ed4fc52440ec0409f87cdb`
for the finalized 105-proposition view, and
`c9d8b5e5d1b199689f9fc0a35c6dc4f19de0a48e4e9815f5ec03ff8ddc62fe34`
for the full-view `phase_a_evidence_packet_v3`. A second clean output directory
at `incremental-terminal-migration-v10` reproduced all four artifacts
byte-for-byte. The earlier v7/v8 runs remain historical evidence but are
superseded: independent review found that their single rederived node replaced
its prior-level `child_relations` with flattened leaf refs. The finalized view
was unaffected, but the node-lineage record and packet source binding were not
lossless and must not be reused.
