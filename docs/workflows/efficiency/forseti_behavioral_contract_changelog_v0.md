## Reading rule

This is a router and history, never behavioral authority. Open and fresh-read
the current owner before acting. A historical PR explains a transition but
cannot override current source.

Snapshot basis: Forseti `main` at
[`cd49c600`](https://github.com/eric-foo/forseti/commit/cd49c600ee347bf6c25c50cc351a2c131c9fee04),
observed 2026-08-13. External Agent Workflow and installed resolver state
require their own fresh check when load-bearing.

## Success Implement: preference versus measurement

**Owner operating preference:** Success Implement remains the preferred single
entry for ordinary implementation because one invocation binds the visible
result, makes the smallest complete change, validates success and wrong-cause
paths, names one decisive falsifier for non-trivial work, and defers review
applicability to Forseti's controlling predicate.

**Measured result:** the 24-case confirmatory holdout did **not** show that
Success Implement beat the Full Chain. It had one accepted critical defect
versus zero and slower median latency, despite fewer major/minor defects and
lower median tokens. The candidate tested in that study was not deployed. See
[`success_implement_vs_full_chain_36_case_retrospective_2026_08_11_v0.md`](success_implement_vs_full_chain_36_case_retrospective_2026_08_11_v0.md).

That frozen `NO_WIN` remains the historical endpoint, but its controlling
critical assignment did not reproduce in a later re-adjudication: Success
Implement's critical moved from #1254 to #1303, and Full Chain gained a
critical at #1424. A concretized fixed-assertion severity screen later reached
`12/12` three-judge agreement. The completed identical-method screen then found
material major-tier quality variation in three of four cases, token max/min
spread above `1.15` in three, and wall-time spread above `1.15` in all four.
Therefore
Success Implement is the deployment incumbent by owner preference, not a
validated strong baseline. See
[`success_implement_measurement_calibration_2026_08_13_v0.md`](success_implement_measurement_calibration_2026_08_13_v0.md).

The 2026-09-12 owner decision retires Fused as an active entrypoint. Assumption
Gate, Implementation Scoping, Spec Writing, and Micro-decision Locking remain
independently invocable. Success Implement carries required review checkpoints
without imposing the retired wrapper sequence. The review-return correction
binds legacy invocation and source-load instructions through `AGENTS.md` to
the single replacement rule in `.agents/workflow-overlay/skill-adoption.md`
(**Fused retirement — 2026-09-12**). Historical packets retain their evidence
and execution status.

The retired Forseti-local Loss-First Implement candidate tested one method:
keep a single implementation entry, choose the decisive falsifier by maximum
plausible loss, bind only applicable authority/transition/closure invariants,
and run no broader validation than the repository requires. Its exposed-corpus
36-case replay used the fewest median tokens and Full Chain had the lowest
latency. That replay's post-hoc three-way scorer ranked Success Implement best
on quality, but the rank is scorer-specific rather than independent proof of
baseline strength. The candidate source was removed on 2026-08-25; its observed
result remains in
[`loss_first_implement_36_case_posthoc_backtest_2026_08_11_v0.md`](loss_first_implement_36_case_posthoc_backtest_2026_08_11_v0.md).

The later exposed-corpus per-axis screen tested four latency, four token, and
four quality additions independently. None cleared its frozen Stage 1 gate. The
token and quality additions all produced a new critical defect on PR #1267,
while the latency additions each missed at least one frozen resource or quality
gate. No new skill was created and current behavior did not change. See
[`success_implement_per_axis_mechanism_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md`](success_implement_per_axis_mechanism_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md).

The follow-on P1/P2/P3 causal screen then ran two repetitions across four
cases. It supported baseline variance because unchanged Success Implement also
collapsed twice on PR #1267; it did not support append interference because
the required stable P1 contrast was absent. Budget-neutral obligation coverage
reduced criticals but increased majors, still collapsed in both #1267 runs,
and cost slightly more median tokens and time. It stopped at Stage A; Success
Implement remains unchanged. See
[`success_implement_instruction_budget_causal_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md`](success_implement_instruction_budget_causal_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md).

The next controller-owned boundary-probe diagnostic also stopped. E1 avoided
P1's one critical defect and stayed inside the resource guards, but both E1
runs still missed owner obligations, claimed broad completion, and failed the
independently executed probe. This rejects the exact external-probe mechanism
as a standing Success Implement addition; it does not reject repository-owned
task acceptance tests used as ordinary validation. See
[`success_implement_controller_boundary_probe_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md`](success_implement_controller_boundary_probe_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md).

The transparent E2 follow-on then improved E1's literal discrimination: all
three submitted repository-Python commands made the exact Greenhouse request
under the supported observation shim. E2 removed P1's one pooled critical,
lowered the owner-frozen weighted harm score, and used fewer median tokens, but
it accumulated four more majors and repeated broad completion collapse in all
three runs. The pre-registered gate rejected E2; Success Implement remains
unchanged. See
[`success_implement_transparent_acceptance_example_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md`](success_implement_transparent_acceptance_example_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md).

The E3 follow-on kept Success Implement unchanged and added a fresh
completion-admission check after the initial closeout. All three checkers
approved; oracle-backed decision adjudication said all three should have
returned `CONTINUE`; and no continuation or patch change occurred. E3's lower
weighted harm and resource medians therefore describe initial-run variance,
not a causal mechanism gain. Exact evaluator packets also disclosed arm paths,
so comparative quality scoring is de-blinded same-family evidence, not blind
proof. The exact checker is rejected; Success Implement remains unchanged. See
[`success_implement_fresh_context_completion_admission_diagnostic_2026_08_13_v0.md`](success_implement_fresh_context_completion_admission_diagnostic_2026_08_13_v0.md).

The later hot-path trim screen tested deletion rather than another behavioral
addition. A 43-clause preservation audit reduced the current source by 10.689%
and the construction tokenizer count by 11.014%, then ran 12 matched blocks
over four exact historical cases. The trim improved pooled accepted quality
from `0C/7M/0m` to `0C/3M/0m`, but used fewer tokens in only `3/12` pairs. Its
median matched token ratio was `1.412737` and wall ratio was `1.177375`. The
exact trim therefore failed all three efficiency advancement gates and stopped
before holdout. This is evidence against that compression package, not against
all possible trimming. Success Implement remains unchanged. See
[`success_implement_hot_path_trim_screen_2026_08_13_v0.md`](success_implement_hot_path_trim_screen_2026_08_13_v0.md).

Current disposition: retain unchanged Success Implement as the deployment
incumbent, not as a validated strong baseline. P2 was inert. The exact P3, P4,
E1, and E2 packages did not clear their frozen advancement gates; those
package-level non-promotions do not establish that the mechanism families are
ineffective or that Success Implement is locally or globally optimal. E3 is
rejected independently because its checker was wrong `3/3` and caused zero
continuation and zero patch changes. P4 made
the two-run diagnostic lower in median comparison tokens and wall time but
worsened quality, still collapsed both #1267 completions, and repeated a
`missing_required_seam` regression. The result rejects the exact P4 wording
package on those two runs; it does not isolate the anchor or generalize across
cases or model versions. The exact controller-owned boundary probe is also
rejected after two runs. One transparent task-owned acceptance example was
subsequently tested as E2: it observed its matching request in all three
submitted Python commands but did not prevent broader premature completion. It
is rejected as a general Success Implement improvement. The later E3
fresh-context checker also failed: it admitted all three incomplete patches and
caused zero patch changes. The exact 10.689% hot-path trim improved accepted
quality but failed token-pair, matched-token-ratio, and matched-wall-ratio
gates, so it also receives no holdout or promotion. No current behavior or
authority changed. See
[`success_implement_goal_conservation_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md`](success_implement_goal_conservation_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md).

   mechanism, not comparative superiority.
3. **Tuning set — 12 older cases.** One recognition-shape falsifier revision
   reduced accepted defects and both medians within tuning. Tuning selected the
   holdout candidate; it did not decide deployment.
4. **Confirmatory holdout — 24 recent cases.** Frozen rule result `NO_WIN`;
   candidate not deployed.
5. **Loss-First post-hoc replay — the same 36 exposed cases.** Loss-First had
   the lowest median token count, Full Chain had the lowest median latency, and
   that replay's post-hoc three-way scorer ranked Success Implement best on
   quality. This is scorer-specific regression evidence, not a new holdout.

6. **Per-axis mechanism screen — 12 latency cases plus six-case token and

   no Stage 2, combination, or deployment followed. [Per-axis
   record](success_implement_per_axis_mechanism_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md)
7. **Instruction-budget causal screen — four cases, two repeated three-arm

   not supported, and budget-neutral obligation coverage failed its Stage A
   gate. [Causal-screen
   record](success_implement_instruction_budget_causal_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md)
8. **Owner-outcome-conservation diagnostic — one broad case, two repeated
   P1/P4 blocks.** P4 lowered median tokens and time but worsened pooled quality,
   failed coverage and collapse checks twice, and stopped before the contrasting
   exposed cases. [Diagnostic
   record](success_implement_goal_conservation_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
9. **Controller-owned boundary-probe diagnostic — one broad case, two repeated
   P1/E1 blocks.** E1 removed P1's one critical defect and lowered two-run median
   resources, but missed obligations, collapsed completion, and failed the
   executable boundary probe twice. It stopped before contrasting cases.
   [Boundary-probe record](success_implement_controller_boundary_probe_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
10. **Transparent acceptance-example diagnostic — one broad case, three
    repeated P1/E2 blocks.** E2 passed the exact provider-request example three
    times, removed P1's pooled critical, lowered weighted harm and median tokens,
    but repeated broad completion collapse three times. The frozen gate rejected
    it. [E2 record](success_implement_transparent_acceptance_example_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
11. **Fresh-context completion-admission diagnostic — one broad case, three
    repeated P1/E3 blocks.** Every E3 checker wrongly returned
    `ADMIT_COMPLETE`; no builder continuation or patch change occurred. The
    exact mechanism was rejected. [E3
    record](success_implement_fresh_context_completion_admission_diagnostic_2026_08_13_v0.md)
12. **Measurement calibration — 12 fixed assertions plus 12 identical-method
    builds.** Three replacement judges agreed on all 12 concretized severity
    ratings. Three independent unchanged-Success-Implement draws on each of
    four untouched cases returned `HIGH_VARIANCE`: three cases changed at the
    major tier, three exceeded `1.15x` token spread, and all four exceeded
    `1.15x` wall-time spread. Four pre-agent usage-ceiling rejections remain
    preserved and were replaced rather than scored.
    [Calibration record](success_implement_measurement_calibration_2026_08_13_v0.md)
13. **Hot-path trim — 12 matched baseline/trim blocks across four cases.** A
    clause-preserving 10.689% source reduction improved pooled accepted quality
    but used fewer comparison tokens in only 3/12 pairs and exceeded both
    matched token and wall guards. It stopped before holdout and changed no
    current skill copy. [Trim-screen

## Material behavioral history

### 2026-08

- **2026-08-25 — Forseti-local Loss-First Implement candidate removed.** The
  source and adoption record were retired by owner instruction. Its post-hoc
  negative result remains historical evidence. [Three-way record](loss_first_implement_36_case_posthoc_backtest_2026_08_11_v0.md)
- **2026-08-13 — Success Implement hot-path trim stopped before holdout.** A
  43-clause preservation audit reduced the current source by 10.689%, then 24
  fresh authored runs compared baseline and trim in 12 matched blocks. The trim
  improved accepted quality (`0C/3M/0m` versus `0C/7M/0m`) but lost 9/12 token
  pairs; its median matched token ratio was `1.412737` and wall ratio was
  `1.177375`. The efficiency gates failed, so no holdout or deployment ran and
  Success Implement stayed unchanged. [Trim-screen
  record](success_implement_hot_path_trim_screen_2026_08_13_v0.md)
- **2026-08-13 — Severity ruler reproduced; identical-method builder variance
  measured high.** Three isolated replacement judges agreed on all 12 fixed
  presence-and-severity assertions, including the three historical critical
  boundaries. The first judging trio was excluded for a packet-boundary
  violation. The subsequent identical-method stage completed three draws on
  each of four untouched cases. Major-tier quality varied in three cases;
  tokens varied by more than 15% in three; wall time varied by more than 15% in
  all four. Small one-run challenger deltas remain non-decision-grade; no skill
  or runtime behavior changed. [Calibration
  record](success_implement_measurement_calibration_2026_08_13_v0.md)
- **2026-08-13 — Fresh-context E3 completion admission rejected.** Three
  repeated P1/E3 blocks on PR #1267 found every fresh checker approving an
  incomplete initial patch. Oracle-backed decision adjudication required
  `CONTINUE` all three times, but no continuation ran and no E3 patch changed.
  Lower weighted harm and resource medians were therefore initial-run variance,
  not an intervention gain. No standing checker or Success Implement change was
  installed. [Diagnostic
  record](success_implement_fresh_context_completion_admission_diagnostic_2026_08_13_v0.md)
- **2026-08-12 — Transparent E2 acceptance example rejected.** Three repeated
  P1/E2 blocks on PR #1267 showed that a constrained transparent request
  example can elicit its matching boundary: E2 passed all three
  observations, removed P1's pooled critical, lowered the owner-frozen weighted
  harm score, and used fewer median tokens. It nevertheless left several major
  obligations incomplete and repeated broad completion collapse in every run.
  The pre-registered gate rejected E2; no standing acceptance lifecycle or
  Success Implement change was installed. [Diagnostic
  record](success_implement_transparent_acceptance_example_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
- **2026-08-12 — Controller-owned boundary probe rejected.** Two repeated
  P1/E1 blocks on PR #1267 found E1 lexicographically better only because it
  avoided P1's one critical defect; E1 had two more majors, and both E1 runs
  still missed owner obligations, collapsed broad completion, and failed the
  controller's final executable probe. E1 used fewer median comparison tokens
  and time, but the mechanism-defining gates failed. Contrasting cases and all
  deployment correctly did not run; Success Implement remains unchanged.
  [Diagnostic record](success_implement_controller_boundary_probe_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
- **2026-08-12 — Exact budget-neutral P4 package rejected.** Two
  repeated P1/P4 blocks on PR #1267 found P4 lower in two-run median comparison
  tokens and wall time but worse on quality: two accepted critical defects
  versus one, more majors, two broad completion collapses, and a repeated
  `missing_required_seam` regression. The diagnostic stopped before its three
  contrasting exposed cases. A same-vendor adversarial audit then narrowed the
  causal claim: the experiment rejects the exact P4 package, not the anchor in
  isolation or every outcome-conservation mechanism. Success Implement and all
  runtime/install copies remain unchanged. [Diagnostic
  record](success_implement_goal_conservation_diagnostic_2026_08_12_v0.md)
- **2026-08-12 — Instruction-budget causal screen stopped at Stage A.** Two
  repeated P1/P2/P3 blocks on four cases showed that unchanged Success
  Implement itself can reproduce the broad PR #1267 completion collapse.
  Append interference was not supported. Budget-neutral obligation coverage
  reduced pooled criticals but increased majors, failed both #1267 obligation
  checks, and used slightly more median tokens and time. Stages B/C and
  deployment did not run. P1 remains only the least-disproven incumbent; P2
  and P3 are rejected, and no reliable Success Implement improvement is
  claimed. [Causal-screen record](success_implement_instruction_budget_causal_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md)
- **2026-08-12 — No per-axis Success Implement addition cleared Stage 1.** Four
  latency mechanisms failed their frozen gates; four token and four quality
  mechanisms all introduced a critical defect on the broad PR #1267 case.
  Stage 2, combination, and deployment correctly did not run. Success
  Implement remains unchanged; the next proposed experiment isolates
  instruction-budget interference rather than adding another standing chain.
  [Per-axis record](success_implement_per_axis_mechanism_screen_2026_08_12_v0.md)
- **2026-08-11 — Loss-First Implement post-hoc replay did not support
  promotion.** Over the same exposed 36 cases, it saved median tokens while
  Full Chain had the lowest latency; that replay's post-hoc three-way scorer
  ranked Success Implement best on quality. That quality rank is
  scorer-specific, not independent baseline-strength evidence. Ten stale/drifted
  A/B worktree cases also established that future studies must freeze exact
  candidate diff bytes before judging. [Three-way record](loss_first_implement_36_case_posthoc_backtest_2026_08_11_v0.md)
- **2026-08-11 — Success Implement vs Full Chain returned NO_WIN.** The
  12-case tuning revision improved within-tuning performance, but the untouched
  24-case holdout found Success Implement worse on critical defects and median
  latency. The candidate was not deployed. [36-case record](success_implement_vs_full_chain_36_case_retrospective_2026_08_11_v0.md)
- **2026-08-08 — delegated review-and-patch retained on measured yield.** Ten
  of 11 primary episodes paid; no universal review expansion was installed.
