## Bound question

Does acquiring one bounded `Most Recent` onboarding window for every distinct
accessible non-Sephora review corpus produce a more complete and reusable
customer-evidence layer than selecting a few products for deep capture first?

The p06 acquisition is the historical control. It was not modified or rerun.
This p07 completion reused its verified 37-PDP REVOLVE corpus and added no new
retailer. It did not start Turn B or author a company report.

## Dogfood execution

The p07 runner loaded all 37 retained REVOLVE PDP packets, verified their
manifests, bound each listing to the observed Yotpo store and product collection
context, and requested only source-labelled `Most Recent` ordering. Each
collection stopped at the shared onboarding bound: the complete source-ordered
30-day cohort when reachable within the cap, otherwise the 30 most recent rows
or source exhaustion. Native review IDs were deduplicated.

```yaml
retailer: revolve
provider: yotpo
requested_listings: 37
verified_listings: 37
distinct_collection_contexts: 37
completed_collection_contexts: 37
failed_collection_contexts: 0
row_positive_contexts: 30
source_declared_zero_row_contexts: 7
captured_occurrences: 607
unique_native_review_ids: 576
cross_context_duplicate_native_ids: 31
observed_overlap_components: 35
status: complete
```

Two overlap edges matter:

- the Jet Lag Mask and Mini Jet Lag Mask contexts shared 30 native review IDs;
- the Pink Dew Gel Cleanser and Mini Pink Dew Gel Cleanser contexts shared one
  native review ID.

Those overlaps are evidence that the displayed collections are related. They
do not make the run fail, and they do not justify collapsing unrelated products
merely because the retailer and Yotpo tenant are shared.

## What the larger board actually contains

The 576 unique native rows contain 78 rows with text other than REVOLVE's
rating-only placeholder and 498 rating-only rows. Normalizing substantive text,
source date, and rating yields 76 unique substantive fingerprints. Of the 78
substantive native rows, 69 are source-marked non-incentivized. Twelve carry
employee-review metadata. Across all unique rows, nine are source-marked
incentivized and 262 carry sweepstakes metadata; none of the sweepstakes rows
contains substantive text in this bounded window.

This is a decision-useful result, including where the yield is thin:

- the board adds non-lip skincare, body, complexion/color, tool, set, and newer
  low-volume contexts that the three-product p06 sample could not represent;
- REVOLVE's admitted 37-listing grid contains no fragrance listing, so this
  retailer cannot close fragrance customer depth;
- high declared review totals often resolve to recent rating-only or campaign
  rows, so review count is not a defensible proxy for narrative yield; and
- native-ID overlap exposes shared or grouped feeds that would otherwise be
  double-counted as independent evidence.

The completed board is reusable acquisition, not a command to interpret all
576 rows. Category-balanced interpretation should prefer substantive,
non-incentivized rows and retain employee, sweepstakes, grouping, and
syndication metadata as claim ceilings.

## p06 control versus p07 completion

| Measure | p06 control | p07 completion | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| REVOLVE collection contexts captured | 3 selected products | 37 / 37 listings | removes hero-product selection from raw acquisition |
| Native review occurrences | 150 | 607 | broader bounded evidence surface |
| Unique native review IDs | 150 | 576 | overlap is removed before evidence counts |
| Substantive native rows | 20 | 78 | materially more usable customer language |
| Unique substantive fingerprints | 19 | 76 | about 4x the distinct narrative substrate |
| Rating-only native rows | 130 | 498 | larger capture does not manufacture narrative evidence |
| Cross-context duplicate IDs | not tested across the full grid | 31 | reveals two shared-feed relationships |
| Zero-row contexts | not inventoried across the full grid | 7 | preserves real no-review outcomes |

The p07 run is better because it moves the selection decision after bounded
acquisition. A later consumer can choose categories or decision-specific
products without reacquiring the unselected catalog. The gain is not that every
row is useful; the gain is that absence, thinness, incentives, overlap, and
available narrative are now known across the admitted retailer denominator.

The bounded cost is also visible: 607 occurrences produced only 76 unique
substantive fingerprints. That is still worthwhile for Phase A because
reacquisition is the expensive, route-sensitive step; interpretation remains
selective. It would not be worthwhile as a full historical crawl or as a rule
to summarize every row.

## Durable company-event closure

The official TSG Consumer announcement was captured as a durable HTTP 200
packet. Its preserved body establishes the dated 2024 strategic growth
investment, the co-founders' retained significant stake and continued
leadership, and Prelude Growth Partners' exit. It also records John Heffner as
Chairman and CEO and Kim Natale as President in the transaction announcement.
Those titles are event-dated facts, not evidence of current 2026 leadership.

The earlier Business Wire route returned an HTTP 403 block shell and is not
evidence. The TSG-owned page is the admitted source.

Primary packet:

- manifest:
  `C:\tmp\forseti-sf-review-corpus-completion-20260725-p07-r3\company-events\tsg-consumer-announcement\manifest.json`
  (`60843928758834abae59bdd036f39a5d9d610f5369bc29038284903fb944acac`);

  (`e1b34ce4034b83a3ca9c4f8414d80a793cfdf307bfd742aba90f3512474b7d00`);
- response metadata:

  (`48c4cb00c373cbb64b903a7d9363e6d4f9ff7b6087089728e383ef73e5d2fa81`).

Sunlit Vanilla is not treated as an acquisition blocker in this completion.

## Adjudication

The implementation and dogfood succeed for the bounded non-Sephora corpus-board
goal. They materially improve the Phase A evidence layer and close the durable
TSG transaction-event gap.

They do not complete the full Summer Fridays acquisition. Sephora is the
official primary retailer and its distinct review-corpus onboarding remains
absent. Under the source-specific policy, each admitted Sephora corpus needs its
bounded Helpful/statistics, Recent, and Q&A roles or a typed terminal outcome.
That remaining primary-retailer gap keeps the acquisition seal blocked.
